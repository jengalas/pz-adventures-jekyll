After a slow start on this last morning of 2006, Rich and I decided around noon to get outside and enjoy the sunshine for a few hours. I wanted to search for a local geocache that he had found about a week and a half ago, on a day that I was working and therefore unavailable to join him. 

Rich has been hiking, hunting, and mountain biking in this area for his entire life, so he knows every twist and turn of every trail.  We took a different route than the one recommended by the cache owner. Our walk was muddy and wet in spots, though we were lucky not to be trudging through snow like we would be most years in December. I found the cache without incident and without assistance, and all was well inside.

After returning the cache to its hiding spot, we wandered the trails some more and found a good spot for some target practice. The clouds soon moved in and the temperature dropped quickly, but the conditions were still pleasant for our walk out of the woods. As Rich always says, any day like this is one less day of Winter, so Iâ€™ll take it! Happy 2007!!!
