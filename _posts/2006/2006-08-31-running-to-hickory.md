HICKORY provided a nice goal for our hike in Hickory Run State Park on this humid August day.  Reaching the station requires a short hike and bushwhack through mostly open woods and thick growth of fernsâ€”neither of which we minded, especially after being stuck in the house for four days due to heavy rain!
