After a meal of delicious pizza at Cara Mia in Dunmore, Aaron and I decided to park at his grandmother's house near Silver Lake and walk down to the tracks to investigate the old trestle over the DL&W tracks (now used for Steamtown excursion trains to Moscow). To my surprise, as we walked beneath the trestle, I happened to spot a benchmark disk set into the east abutment. I knew of its existence because Rich and I had planned to search for it on a ride at some point, but I hadn't realized it was on the trestle Aaron had told me about so many times.
