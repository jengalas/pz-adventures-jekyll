***06 JAN 2007: Lizardboy and I refreshed with a new logbook and baggies.***

Traveling down the main street in Luray, you'll find the Carillon. During the summer, you might catch a concert of the bells, too.

Park in the small lot as you approach, and walk up on the flag side. Each corner of the tower has a clump of trees that you can walk under. On the tower is a memorial sign, and to the left a clump of trees holding your own memorial.

There aren't a lot of visitors, but it is in town, so be careful. You won't have any trouble finding a place to spread out your supplies.

Let me know when you find it. A Light in the Darkness and Lake Arrowhead are nearby.

Thanks,
FamilyMan -->
