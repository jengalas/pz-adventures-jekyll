We left before 7:00am in a light drizzle.  Typical for PA, it was foggy and cloudy all through the state, but sunny by the time we reached Maryland.  We made only one stop along the way, at the rest stop (Chambersburg?) to pee.  We had brought coffee and cranberry bread for the drive down.  Arrived in Front Royal by a bit after 11:00am, stopped for gas and then were on our way to the park entrance.  (Remember lots of neat old stone buildings in Front Royal!)

We paid the permit fee at the gate; it's gone up to $15.  Then we continued along Skyline Drive toward the Dickey Ridge welcome center (at mile 4?), stopping at overlooks along the way.  The weather was sunny but cool, with a very cold wind blowing as we discovered when we got out at the center!  We bought several maps and guidebooks at the shop, examined the displays and then watched the short (10 minute?) movie about the park.  We had some crappy photos of us taken by a guy who looked like he knew what he was doing - and claimed to be there every day taking photos - but obviously did not.  

Then we continued along the drive, stopping at each overlook and looking for HW3288 and HW3666 (at interchange) before exiting the drive and the park and heading west on 211 toward Luray.

We checked in at the Days Inn, which was not luxurious but was OK.  After taking some time to relax and go through our brochures, we decided to try Mindi's Mexican Restaurant for supper.  Had some trouble finding it.  Not authentic, but the food was OK.  The salsa I remember as being quite good.  We initiated our "star rating" and gave Mindi's a 2.5 (**+). We stopped at Food Lion and the wine store, then went back to the room and watched Tomb Raider until we fell asleep. -->
