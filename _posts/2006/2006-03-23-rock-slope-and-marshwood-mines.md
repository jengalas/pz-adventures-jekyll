Two consecutive March Thursdays were warm and sunny (the second warmer than the first) and we were in the mood to track down some local mining ruins.  Our first goal was the Eddy Tunnel portal.  I'd asked an acquaintance &quot;in the know&quot; for directions to this portal (or so I thought).  We were to park just off Underwood Road at a gate and then follow the dirt road and then "make your very first right.. maybe  200 meters? on your left into the woods 25 meters at best... there's what looks like a cage coming out of the ground".  Following these directions to the letter was difficult so we let our intuition guide us, and we soon arrived at a very likely spot.  Alas, several yards distant in the woods stood the rust-colored batgate covering a mine entrance! 

We hurried toward it, excited by the find but soon realizing that the portal to the Eddy Tunnel most likely was not anywhere nearby.  The Rock Slope (1915) portal, mostly buried in fill, was adjacent to the gated mine shaft opening, but no other portal was anywhere to be found.  We reflected that this wasn't even a particularly logical place for another opening, especially of the type we expected the Eddy Tunnel to be.  These were still exciting finds, and though we dared not venture inside today  for a peek at all the artifacts within, we were certainly intrigued and may return once we procure the proper equipment and gain some training.

On our way back to the highway, Rich had me pull off Marshwood Road just west of the highway ramp.  He wanted to investigate a shed he'd noticed set back in the woods.   The shed itself wasn't very interesting—though all things become more interesting the more you know about them, so I will keep searching for information about it.  Beyond the shed, though, we spotted several dark areas in the ledge and went to investigate.  We'd found a series of mine openings!  Three can be entered, two very easily.  At the third mine, a wooden pillar still props up the opening.
