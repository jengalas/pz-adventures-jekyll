Circumstances combined such that today was the first day we were able to get a bagel and a slice of blueberry pie and take them to the waterfront for breakfast. It was already hot and very humid by 7:30am and we were loving it! We wre happy to be able to enjoy the spicy cilantro cream cheese on a 3 seed bagel and Morning Glory's blueberry pie is always good.

We sat and ate ad talked for a while, and then wandered out on the Margaret Todd pier to take some photos of the Winter Harbor ferry as it headed out for the first trip of the day.

After hiking Hadlock Ponds today, we went in search of 5 survey markers out toward Seal Cove. Only found 1, but found lots of buggy spots and stinging nettles while looking for the others. I still wouldn't trade it for anything! Oh, and we found the entrance to the old Browns Mountain trail. (We'll have to save the hike for next time.) I didn't realize there are two signs for it, very close together!

Dinner at Havana was amazing as always. That place is always perfect! We started with mojitos, bread (multigrain and blueberry cornbread with the assortment of dips: white bean, chili oil and cinnamon honey butter) and the little "treat" of smoked chicken with chipotle on a corn chip. Then we got the usual appetizer: spring rolls stuffed with mushrooms and a soy aioli that melts in your mouth. Best spring rolls I've ever tasted.

We both couldn't resist the halibut entree: pan seared halibut with baby eggplant, green beans, yellow carrots and a broccoli-sesame sauce. Absolutely delicious and just the perfect size to give us plenty to eat yet still have room for dessert. We shared the quatro leches with strawberry-blood orange sauce and almond brittle. Fabulous. and after a short walk around town, we just had to get yet another little dessert - baby scoop of maple walnut for R and blackberry basil for me. Can't resist and it will be at least another year until we can get them again! (Often they don't have so many great sorbet flavors all at once so I really hit them hard this year!)

On our way back we were talking about how strange it always is that we feel like we were only here a few days and yet we feel months removed from our lives at home.
