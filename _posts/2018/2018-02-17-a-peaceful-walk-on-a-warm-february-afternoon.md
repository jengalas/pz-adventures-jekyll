By early afternoon, it was so warm that Rich and I were inspired to walk to the neighborhood park for some explorations. We found the creek running fast and a full, steady flow over the waterfall. 

Just an hour after we came back inside the house, the wind whipped up suddenly from the northwest and began flinging sleet and then flakes against the house. The storm lasted several hours and left us with another coating of snow. Winter's not over yet.
