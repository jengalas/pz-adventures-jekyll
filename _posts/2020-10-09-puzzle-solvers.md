  This morning Rich and I solved two more puzzle caches, although because they were very easy and straightforward and already had a few other solvers, we decided not to log a “solved it” note like we’ve done for some others recently.

This morning Rich and I solved two more puzzle caches, although because they were very easy and straightforward and already had a few other solvers, we decided not to log a “solved it” note like we’ve done for some others recently. We still had a great time working on [JUMBLE Puzzles are NOT Rocket Science!](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC910J6) and [A HISTORIC DOUBLE SUDOKU](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC90B96). Rich had a puzzle geocache based on Jumble puzzles all set up and ready to go years ago, but we could never find just the right place to hide it, so we never did. This morning I heard “Hey, this guy stole my idea!” a few times! :sunglasses:
