We’ve had this puzzle cache on our minds for a few days, but hadn’t had a chance to sit down and solve it. Rich found what appeared to be a hidden clue and at first we were sure that was all we needed to do—we just needed to find the time. Well, this morning we sat down to solve it. We easily translated the clue we had found, only to find that it was a red herring!

Some cursing ensued, and then we got back to work. We decided to tackle the “obvious” code on the page. In the process I discovered a great online cryptographic tool ([https://cryptii.com/](https://cryptii.com/)) and we decoded the text, only to find that it was yet another red herring.

Finally, we tried another idea that is normally one of the very first things we check (I suppose we didn’t this time because we were distracted by the `red herrings`). Alas, the discovery of this piece, knowledge of what it was, and the use of another online tool to make the translation easier were all it took to have the solution in hand.
