No, this isn’t one of *those* kinds of posts. I certainly don’t have any actual answers to major questions, but we did solve a fun geocache puzzle this evening. We had come across this listing a few days ago, but didn’t have any good ideas about what to do with it. I was in the bathtub this evening when a good idea struck (no, I did not leap out of the tub shouting “Eureka!”) and it turned out to be correct. This certainly was a fun cache for a coder!
