This puzzle geocache, another one by zzbob, had us going crazy for a day or so just like the last one. It turns out that we were expecting something a little more challenging than it turned out to be! We had come across the correct answer early on, but we didn't see how it could possibly be right, so we didn't check it. Rich eventually did, and it was right! This afternoon we headed down to the final location, which, sad to say, was another disappointing spot like the last one.  Good parking was available, which is always a plus, but it was just too public a spot to feel comfortable poking around for long. And in mid-July, it really wasn't possible to poke around much in the area anyway because it was so overgrown with knotweed and, as we found out too late, poison ivy! There was one object in the area that seemed a likely hiding spot, but there are so many places to check that we just couldn't reach. If we try again, it will have to be during the colder months.
