We were supposed to have been on a plane this morning, heading to Arizona for two weeks of hiking and exploring in the warmth and sunshine! Unfortunately, our plans changed radically at the last minute due to the coronavirus. We decided yesterday morning that it would be wisest to cancel our plans, and try again to make our trip in the fall or next spring. We tried to make the best of a miserable situation and at least get out to enjoy the sunshine this morning, and some meager signs of new life appearing near Trostle Pond in Lackawanna State Park.
