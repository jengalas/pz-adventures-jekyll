Rich casually mentioned a new puzzle cache a little over a week ago. I love puzzles, so I was intrigued immediately, and we both began working on it. And it drove us nuts until last night! We tried _**everything**_ we could think of, focusing our efforts on the geocacher in honor of whom the cache was placed (thinking that the numbers we needed might be found among his statistics somehow). 

Finally, yesterday morning, Rich had a major inspiration that led us in a completely different direction, and it turned out to be correct! It was so cool to see everything fall into place once he made that initial discovery.

We were unable to make the trip yesterday, but we decided that today we'd take a drive to the area, retrieve the cache, and then look for a few benchmarks nearby. On our way home, we'd stop at the Cactus Man to see what was new this year!

Finding and retrieving the cache wasn't quite as easy as we had expected. I can't give too much away, but I'll say that it required a few unexpected activities, like wading in gnat- and rusted-bridge-part-infested water just to finally spot the geocache ... followed by the realization that we had no idea how we would be able to retrieve it. We found a tool and used some coordinated teamwork to retrieve it. It must have been hilarious to watch, and we were initially thinking we would recreate it for a few photos, but once we had signed the logbook and put the cache back where we had found it (or nearly so), we were both just ready to leave.

We searched for a few benchmarks along the way, both before and after the geocache, and stopped at the Cactus Man as planned. He had a lot of beautiful new plants, including some nice _Mammillaria matudae_. But Rich and I both liked a _Pilosocereus_ and a _Pachycereus pringlei_ the most, and that's what we bought. (See photos below in our geocache logs.)
