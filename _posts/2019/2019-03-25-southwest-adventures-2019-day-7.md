Oatmeal for breakfast
Hike at Linda Vista loop - awesome views and extremely high cactus density! Why so may kids everywhere?!  Everyone has spring break now?! Saw Phainopepla for the first time, never heard of it before.
Cactus shopping at Bach's
Late lunch at Nana's Kitchen, where they decide to close early and we got "locked in" - there are worse things!
Both very tired so we went back tt he room early and just rested and read for the remainder of the evening.
