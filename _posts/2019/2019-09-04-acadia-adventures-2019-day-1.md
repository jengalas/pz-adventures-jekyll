The Mooses are heading to Maine!

Last year's departure time of just before 4:00pm worked out so well that we decided to try it again this year. Traffic was heavy—generally not insane, as it often can be, but consistently heavy over our entire route. We passed through a few strong storms in Connecticut, but fortunately they were short-lived. We just barely (probably only by a few minutes) missed a strong line of severe storms, including tornado warnings, that blew through Hartford around 7:00pm.  

Our snack at Rein's Deli was quick: chili and coffee for Rich, and lox cream cheese on a poppyseed bagel with tea for me. I was tempted, as usual, to order the potato pancakes, but I restrained myself this time. We did, of course, purchase some candy fruit slices as trail snacks, and a slice of cheesecake and pound cake for breakfast in the morning. <!--Around 7:30pm.-->

We made it to the rest area just before 11:00pm, tired but excited for whatever adventures are to come!
