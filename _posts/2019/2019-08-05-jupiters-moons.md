It has been a long time since I've posted one of these. Last night, Rich and I were relaxing on the deck while the sun set and the sky grew darker. Suddenly a bright spot appeared in the sky above one of the distant birch trees. "I'll bet that's Jupiter," Rich said, and he brought out the scope so we could check for its Galilean moons. We could see three of them easily!
