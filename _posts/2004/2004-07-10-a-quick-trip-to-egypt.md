Rich and I were trying to come up with a plan for today's activities, but nothing was really grabbing us. We hadn’t really considered heading east to try the "Lackawaxen in Hawley" geocache, but when we saw the difficulty Buzz had yesterday when he searched for it, we became more intrigued and the deal was sealed. We decided we’d try our skills on the cache first thing in the morning, and then head to the Bruce Lake/Promised Land State Park area for a benchmark hunt and, if time and energy allowed, some mountain biking on the fine trails nearby.

We arrived in Hawley just after 9:00am and found the park easily enough. I was immediately drawn to the bright purple bistro on the corner across from the entrance to the park, but I didn’t let myself get too distracted right off; there would be plenty of time to explore later. We headed right toward the coordinates, but had to stop about 50 feet away—they were leading us right into the river! Figuring it was a simple error on the part of my GPSr, I continued to search along the shore at the spot nearest the coordinates.

Rich looked for a few minutes too, but we saw nothing of interest except a pretty river view, and a lone fisherman wading in the water. We expanded the search, even to areas that seemed unlikely, and I found nothing but copious amounts of poison ivy and some red raspberry bushes bearing very few, but very delicious, berries. I was poking around down near the water again when I saw Rich pacing and realized he’d probably found the cache. He had, he told me, or so he thought. Given one tiny hint, I began to stroll around the park once more and soon stumbled upon the mysterious container. I picked it up and opened it to be sure it was the cache. Claw or teeth marks were evident immediately.

While Rich signed the logbook, I wandered around in search of abandoned buildings to explore. No luck at that time, but after rehiding the cache as best we could, we took a walk to the nearby railroad tracks and did discover an abandoned concrete tower from 1922. We also took a peek through the windows of the purple bistro. I was enticed by their claim to provide “The Best Lunch on Welwood Avenue” but alas, they were not yet open for the day.

Next, we moved on to EGYPT. Not the enchanting land of the ancient pyramids, but the triangulation station named after nearby Egypt Meadow Lake in the Bruce Lake Natural Area. This triangulation station and related marks have been on our to-do list for a long time. They are situated so close to the road that we figured they'd be effortless finds—in fact, we were sure another local benchmark hunter would recover them first. We needn't have worried. The marks may be just yards from the highway, but the station and reference marks are in an area heavily overgrown with blueberry bushes and were hidden beneath several inches of soil and plant debris.

We found all four marks easily, including the azimuth mark, which is 0.2 miles south on Route 390 from the station, directly across the highway from the Bruce Lake parking area. All marks are in good condition and clearly legible; the station and reference marks are now flush with the ground. We were not able to positively identify the triangular blazed tree (note that there is some confusion among the datasheet descriptions whether this tree is an ash or an oak). In addition, there is a stake near the station mark which was probably the witness marker mentioned in the description. There is no sign or other identifying feature. Near the azimuth mark, no witness marker was found.
