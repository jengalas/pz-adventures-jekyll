  Today's sole adventure consisted of a nice bike ride to a triangulation station recovery! It was a real treat on a pleasant spring day.  We found a few changes in the area to report, as well as an error on the datasheet.

Our recovery of DUNN was one of my last benchmarking adventures on my first mountain bike. Rich and I rode from my house in Scranton along Elmhurst Boulevard to Blue Shutters Road, and then turned into the woods on the woods road we suspected would take us to DUNN. We'd driven back here once before (staying more on the "main" woods road rather than taking the forking road toward DUNN) so we had a good idea what type of terrain we'd encounter. With the bikes, travel was easy and we soon reached the top of the knoll. 

It took only a minute to spot the old witness sign nailed to a dead tree. We made the mistake of assuming the witness sign had originally been placed on the tree and the measurements had been taken from that spot, and we were thus a little worried when we couldn't find the station mark after a good ten minutes of searching. Rich finally spotted the concrete monument, half-buried and a good 12 feet east (rather than 6 feet south) from the witness sign. We concluded that the sign had been moved at some point.

It was simple to find where RM 1 had once been set. Unfortunately, the monument has been vandalized and the disk is gone. The monument is located as described, and is now situated in the middle of the track road going over the hilltop and through the rock wall.

RM 2 posed another challenge. As usual, we initially followed the written description and were thus searching north of the witness sign and station, even though it didn't make much sense (RM 1 is also roughly north of the witness sign and station). We eventually resorted to the box score and discovered that RM 2 is actually southwest of the witness sign and station. This knowledge brought us directly to the monument and marker. The disk is in good condition.
