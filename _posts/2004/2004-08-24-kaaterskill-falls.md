I was pretty excited when Rich suggested taking a day trip to Kaaterskill Falls. He's talked about the falls before, and I could hardly wait to see them for myself. I was also aware of a [letterbox](https://www.letterboxing.org/boxes/view.php?boxnum=1024) hidden somewhere nearby, and immediately I put that on the list of possible activities for the day along with a few survey marks and a geocache.

We began our day with a search for benchmark [C 281](http://surveymarks.planetzhanna.com/surveymarks/na0423/), right in the heart of Palenville. It was another fiercely guarded mark! We found the mark without being seen, but I'd advise against wandering on the grounds of the old library unless you want to be screamed at by a nasty teenage "princess" who thinks she owns the place.  A search for two other marks along Route 23A ([F 281](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=NA0426) and [G 281](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=NA0427)) was not so successful. 

We then continued up the highway, managed to find a parking spot and hiked through the cool woods toward the falls. Dodging tourists and teenagers hanging out at the base of the falls, we made our way to the boulder and found "S. Root" without any trouble. We followed the clues and within a minute Rich was pulling the letterbox out from its hiding spot. No one seemed to be paying much attention as we stamped in, even though there was a family posing for photographs a little too close for my comfort. 

The rest of our day was spent exploring the falls en route to the Kaaterskill Falls geocache; Rich's log and my log detail the entire adventure thoroughly.
