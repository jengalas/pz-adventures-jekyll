This morning I awoke to sunshine and the promise of a day free from work. Of course, I would pick the shortest day of the year (in the Northern Hemisphere :sunglasses:) for my day off. At least the weather cooperated; what’s wrong with 12° when the sun is shining and the winds are calm?! Rich and I both needed to spend some time outdoors after being cooped up for several days. “GODZILLA!” had intrigued us from the moment it appeared on the site. Just the day before, in fact, Rich had expressed an interest in squirrel hunting at Nescopeck State Park. This morning we decided to combine the two activities into one wintry adventure. I also brought along some benchmark datasheets just in case we had some energy left after visiting Godzilla.

The frigid air was still as we hiked through silent woods on trails covered with just a dusting of snow, and some ice here and there. The sun disappeared soon after our hike began. We gained elevation gradually as we followed the switchbacking trail to the top of the ridge; the climb was enough to keep us warm, and I’m glad there was no need to bushwhack! We reached the top of the ridge after a 2-mile hike, and Godzilla very quickly came into view. The cache was a straightforward find, though it was covered well and was difficult to maneuver out of the claws of the monster (which is not necessarily a bad thing!). We signed in and made our trades (I left several Disney character rubber stamps, and took nothing), and had a snack while checking over our shoulders to make sure we didn’t wake the dozing monstrous reptile. Perhaps ‘Zilla is hibernating for the season. When we were done I carefully returned the box to his frozen grasp—I thought I heard a snort or a low growl at this point, but there was no movement—and we took off along the trail, heading back the way we’d come.

We took a very slow walk back to the car, scouting the woods for squirrels or, toward the end, any sign that we and Godzilla weren’t the only forms of animal life in the forest today. We finally heard and then spotted a woodpecker, but little else. By the time we arrived back at the car the sun was out again, and we took a quick walk to attempt to recover a nearby survey mark, 6 JPN. The only true disappointment of the day was finding that someone long ago had vandalized the mark, removing the disk from its setting.
