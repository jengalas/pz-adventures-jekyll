I had the day off from work and couldn't think of a better way to spend it than geocaching and benchmark hunting with Rich. Our first target was a new geocache by veteran cacher RenegadeJane, near the Ledgedale Natural Area. After an early (7:40am) start, we headed east on I-84 toward the natural area.  We located the trailhead with some difficulty, parked and were on our way by 8:20am. It was a chilly, damp, cloudy morning, with the sky threatening rain, just the perfect atmosphere for a walk in a lush dark forest. In some places there were brilliant green ferns as far as the eye could see. We encountered no wildlife but could hear bird songs from the branches above us, which broke the silence but still added to the peacefulness of the experience. 

While Rich composed his log, I explored the area around the split rock, eventually discovering tree branches on which I could swing as if they were monkey bars. (This was great fun and I even posed, swinging, for a photo!) Luckily for us the rain didn’t come, and we took our time on the return hike, making the complete loop and stopping for photos and little explorations and reflections along the way.

Back at the Zhannamobile, we snacked on pizza and took a few more photos while leisurely putting away our gear and planning out our next adventure. It wasn’t a big surprise to see a red truck pull into the parking area a few minutes later. We figured someone else would’ve been here by now, for sure! Our fellow geocacher was DeadBird652; as always, it was a pleasure chatting with him. We talked geocaching and GPSr’s for the better part of an hour before splitting up. DeadBird then disappeared into the forest, and Rich and I continued down to School House Road for a rather eventful benchmark recovery—F 234.

The benchmark description led us to believe that this one would be an easy find, but we had trouble finding the large rock "shelf". It wasn't obvious from the road as we had expected it would be. After poking around for a few minutes, we tried a different approach. Rich paced off approximately 250 feet along School House Road from its intersection with Ledgedale Road. We then turned 90° to the right, walked into the woods and immediately saw the shelf right in front of us. As described, the mark is set in the top of the east end of the shelf. 

Our next benchmark search, for G 234, was much simpler.  We basically walked right up to the mark and found it in good condition. And our third search wasn't much of a search at all.  We could see immediately upon arriving at the intersection of Route 739 and Blooming Grove Road that the "small store house" whose foundation had once held R 25 was completely gone.

We ended the day with a cache-and-dash at a truck stop/rest area just off I-84 and a small snack at the McDonald's nearby. It may not have been gourmet, but after a full day of active adventures, those greasy fries tasted great!
