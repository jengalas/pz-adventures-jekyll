It didn’t turn out as warm or as sunny this Sunday as the forecast had promised, but we wanted to spend some time outdoors anyway. Our goal for the day was to complete an easy cache hunt somewhere in the area and then search for the Smiths Gap Reset triangulation station just off the A-T at Smith Gap. 

After some difficulty finding the right exit off Route 33, we navigated through back roads to the Smith Gap A-T parking area. From here we trekked down the long, winding and steep road toward the cache. Cutting into the woods on a dim trail not far from houses seemed to be the easiest route, terrain-wise. 

Then, trouble. From the yard of one of the nearby homes I heard a bark, and then a large black dog came toward us through the woods. Neither of us being a fan of strange dogs allowed to run free, we were ready for anything, including giving up the hunt if the dog refused to let us pass. 

He stayed silent while he sniffed us and trotted around, sizing us up. Rich reached out tentatively to let the dog sniff his hand, and the dog flopped on the ground! This dog was ready to play. There was no danger and we continued on our way. 

Our new friend accompanied us for the rest of the journey, trotting alongside us, and occasionally running ahead to take a drink and play in the little streams that crossed our path. He was eager to look for the cache, as well! He went looking here, sniffing there as we poked under rocks and examined fallen trees. He and I found the cache after a few minutes of looking, and Rich found it himself just a minute later. 

Our trading and logging in was complicated by the dog bounding all around us, wondering what was going on and wanting to play. Though there were some nice goodies in the cache, I took nothing and left a laptop cord. The dog eventually settled down for a few photos before walking us back out to the road. It might be a while before he has such an adventure again! 

I’ve never been a fan of dogs, particularly big ones, but after meeting this sweetheart I can understand how people become so attached to these creatures.
