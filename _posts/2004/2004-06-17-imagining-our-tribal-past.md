Today we spent the morning on a hike in the Thunder Swamp trail system, part of the Delaware State Forest in Pike County. In spite of taking a wrong turn here and there, we found the geocache we were looking for and had a great time hiking these trails through the lush (in June, anyway) forest. On our way home, we visited the colorfully-named Dancing Ridge to search for an old fire tower, which was also an NGS landmark station. Unfortunately the tower is destroyed, but we still thorougly enjoyed our visit to this hilltop location. We also found enough evidence to send to NGS so they could mark the tower as Destroyed in the database.
