Our main adventure for the morning was a scenic hike along beautiful Wallenpaupack Creek, during which we found the Little Falls Cache. On our way home, we decided to extend our morning's adventures by searching for a few benchmarks along Route 390. S 234 was an easy find, while T 234's disk was missing.
