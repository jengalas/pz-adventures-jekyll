About two weeks ago, Rich and I were on our way to Tanners Falls, and the geocache there, when we decided to change our plans and detour to Prompton Dam instead. Today we finally made it to the falls. And what a great day it was, warm (for Winter) and full of adventures!

Even the drive to the falls was exciting. It was my first time being guided by a Garmin iQue 3600, Rich’s new Xmas toy. There’s nothing quite like the peacefulness of driving on country roads punctuated by **Boing!** “In 300 feet, turn right.” Our first attempt to approach the falls was blocked by a Road Closed sign with, apparently, no road beyond it. We probably could have parked and walked down the hill, but we didn’t trust the neighbors to be friendly or forgiving, and we knew that it wouldn’t be necessary to trespass to reach the geocache anyway. We looked for another route and found easy access just another mile and a half south on Route 670.

The falls were beautiful and half frozen when we arrived. We took a long slow hike over the bridge and up the hill, chatting and looking for squirrels as we walked. (A little squirrel did pop out of the woods at one point, but he was too quick for us.) Eventually we entered the woods and slipped and slid toward the cache! Wet leaves covered by slushy snow on a steep hillside makes for pretty slick conditions. The cache was hidden well—without being so hard to find that people would be tempted to tear the area apart. 

If it had been warmer this would have been a perfect spot for a picnic! The sound of the rushing water was very soothing. We took a few photos and signed the logbook before heading off on the rest of the day’s adventures, which began with a long hike and squirrel hunt on gamelands trails alongside the creek. We were unsuccessful in our squirrel searching, but enjoyed the hike and the chance to learn more about the trails in the area.

Just one more activity would make the day complete. My USGS datasheets indicated a chiseled square benchmark on the bridge over the falls. We found it easily and took photos (somewhat less easily). We then drove a short distance north to search for another mark near the East Branch of Dyberry Creek. The third mark I had planned for the day was closer to the falls, so we drove back the way we’d just come, driving over the bridge this time and heading toward the benchmark coordinates, or so we thought.

Where were we? Maps didn’t help, GPS didn’t really help. Nothing we saw on the maps seemed to match up with what we saw with our own eyes. At one point Rich brought out his handheld GPS to compare maps when we were unable to get a satellite lock with the iQue. My only regret is that I didn’t have my own new Garmin GPSmap 76CS, which was defective and had to be returned for replacement. With all three mapping units lined up on the dash we’d have looked like true techno-geeks fumbling about in the wilderness!!! (As it was, of course, two on the dash and my yellow eTrex in the cupholder only qualified us for semi-techno-geek status.) Eventually, we figured out that the road we wanted must have been the closed road we’d encountered earlier, and we couldn’t take it straight through to the mark. A detour around the “block” brought us right to the benchmark.

There’s plenty more exploring to do near Tanners Falls, and I can’t wait to return!
