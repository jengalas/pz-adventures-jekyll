**11:00pm**

It was a murky, hazy night with heavy cloud cover.  Arriving home around 10:30pm, I had little hope we'd see anything in the sky and was about to declare that it was a good night for a beer and maybe some TV.  But we lounged outside on the patio just a little longer, and our faithful friend Jupiter emerged from the haze, moons intact!

**4:00am (Tuesday)**

At 4:00am, skies were still clear and all four moons were visible to the right of the planet.
