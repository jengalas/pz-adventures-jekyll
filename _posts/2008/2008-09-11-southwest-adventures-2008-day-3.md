Oak Creek-Sedona -> Sunset Crater -> Wupatki -> Kayenta

Relatively early start: after breakfast, drove up Oak Creek Canyon (bitch in VW!) to Sunset Crater. Photos and lots of poking around. Hiked short version of Lava Flow Trail. Continued on drive to Wupatki. Saw at least 4-5 witness posts along the way, but stopped for only 2. Great views from all the overlooks. Saw most of the Wupatki ruins, then continued on to Cameron with storms looming (went to Simpson's market!). To Tuba City ("Well, I guess it's <em>some </em>form of civilization!") where we saw a sign denoting a McDonalds "one hour away." Saw hand-lettered signs for Dinosaur Tracks and finally found the entrance, but didn't stop.  Just past Elephant Feet, we attempted to get to White Mesa Arch but found the road flooded out. Found entrance to Keet Seel and Betatakin Ruins but it was already closed for the day.  Finally arrived at Anasazi Inn-what a place!!! Current spider count:1. Went to Amigo Cafe for supper-what a place! Then stopped at Hampton Inn to see if they had any info on Monument Valley tours.  They didn't, but we did buy a packet of mixed cacticus seeds.  On the way out we passed a dog that appeared completely dead on the sidewalk.  Walking past didn't stir him.  Finally we saw a twitch and realized with relief that he was alive.

Notes: Sunset Crater Visitor Center: N 35째 22.157' W111째 32.614'

-Remember to look up electric railway alongside Route 160 - remember vehicle tunnel and horrible road, nice Indians, strange "elevator" and huge conveyor crossing road and over cliffs on E side of road.  http://www.utahgeology.com/roadguides.php?hw=hw160

Food: Huevos rancheros for both, grapefruit and cranberry juice, coffee @ Oak Creek Cafe.  Cape Cod chips, beef jerky from "Simpson's Market" on Rt. 89 in Cameron. Beef and green chile burrito (R), tostadas, iced tea at Amigo Cafe ... ha-ha!
