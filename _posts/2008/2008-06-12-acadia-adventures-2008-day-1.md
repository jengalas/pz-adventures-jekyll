Food: sandwich spread sandwich, chips, watermelon that Rich brought over to me before we left home around 6:30pm.  Bagel and cream cheese at Rein's (roast beef Reuben for R.).  We noticed there were no pickles on the table!

The first part of the drive was smooth, with some very light traffic but nothing insane.  We reached Rein's by 10:15pm and ate after filling the gas tank and washing the windshield.  After leaving, I remembered that I had forgotten to print out the REST tri-station datasheet.  If I knew the PID I could use the application I wrote for my phone to call up the datasheet, but I didn't know the PID.  How could we get the data?  We wondered if some of the rest stops on the Mass Pike would have free Wi-fi.  We ended up stopping at the Charlton East Plaza around 12:15am ... we discovered that it does, in fact, have free wi-fi and we were able to tote my laptop inside and grab the data we needed.  

Two more hours of driving put us at the rest area in Kittery.  We found a relatively dark end spot in the parking lot, cleaned up in the bathrooms, and tried to sleep.
