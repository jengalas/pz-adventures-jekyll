Kayenta -- Four Corners -- Mesa Verde

Escaped Kayenta mostly intact.  Drove straight to Four Corners, finally got photos of station, found RM, found Supreme Court mark.  Bought t-shirt and frybread-no 4-corners BM pin here! On to Welcome Center in Cortez and "got stuff, asked questions, got answers" and then came to Mesa Verde. Stopped at overlooks, checked out Point Lookout trail, did Park Point BMs, went to (Far view) Visitors Center (remember tunnel from parking lot under road!) where we got tickets for the Cliff Palace and Balcony House tours for Monday (10:00 and 11:30).  Checked in, then went to Naked Moose, looking for AZ MK along the way but could not find it anywhere.

Food: breakfast, McD's, see Saturday. Naked Moose: One Crying Moose (onion blossom w/ranch dressing), Yukon Moose burger (green chile sauce, cheese), sweet potato fries; Easy Moose w/American cheese (R); Moose Drool brown ale, SKA Pinstripe.  -->
