**9:45pm**


Tonight Rich was at work, but I went to try to view Jupiter anyway.  He didn't miss much!  Right after I arrived, thick fog moved in ... it was almost like being in Maine.  Irritatingly bright light from the park across the street reflected off the fog and made the situation even worse.  I couldn't see a single thing in the sky other than Jupiter, and even that was very faint.  I couldn't find it through the camera at all.  I watched through the scope for a while and eventually I was able to see three moons.  I could see Ganymede far to the left decently well, but I could only see Io and Europa if I looked at Jupiter rather than at them.  And I could only see (or rather "sense") Callisto if I zoomed out a bit.
