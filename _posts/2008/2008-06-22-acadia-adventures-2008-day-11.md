Today's breakfast was at Jeannie's again: we really can't get enough of that place this year! It's friendly and inviting, open early, and even though it's always busy, service it great so things move quickly. This morning I enjoyed two wild blueberry pancakes and orange juice, and a few sips of Rich's coffee. Rich had two egg and cheese sandwiches with bacon and a side of home fries (he must have been extra-hungry!). 

After breakfast, we went out on the bikes. Today's ride took us along the old Hio Road



At some point during today's adventures, we decided we were in the mood for dinner at Havana. When we returned to our room in the afternoon, we called and made reservations for 6:30pm. And it was worth the wait and the huge appetite we had worked up! 

Havana always serves a basket of delicious bread before the meal, which we enjoy with mojitos. The basket contains a few slices of whole-grain bread, usually some French-style bread, and cornbread that is always different. Tonight's cornbread contained sweet potatoes and green onions, and was served with orange honey butter. I really liked it.

We shared two appetizers: lettuce wraps filled with carrot and spicy crab meat, and mushroom spring rolls (assorted wild mushrooms, Japanese wheat noodles with mirin soy reduction and roasted corn poblano aioli - best appetizer ever!). We then shared a bowl of hot & sour mushroom soup with a turnip base. 

And if that wasn't enough, we still had our entrees to look forward to. Apparently we were in the mood for "beast" tonight as we had the Argentinian-style skirt steak (served with papaya chimichurri and Peruvian potato salad, and topped with thinly sliced onions) and the filet mignon verde (served with spicy tomatillo salsa verde, and served on top of whipped potatoes with spinach and blue cheese).

It may sound excessive, but Havana's portions are reasonable, and the food is so delicious and well-prepared it's hard to skip any courses! We even had dessert, which was just a simple scoop of local blackberry ice cream.
