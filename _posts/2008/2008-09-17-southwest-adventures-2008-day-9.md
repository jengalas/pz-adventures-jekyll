Canyon de Chelly

After breakfast did White House Ruins hike, then did rest of South Rim overlooks that we didn't get to see yesterday.  The vortex hat was busy again: rain started at Face Rock overlook and was pouring by Spider Rock overlook.  Came back to room to get dried off, then did the North Rim overlooks, with the exception of Ledge Rock, which we couldn't find.  It seemed to be the blocked off road at around mile 5.5. Awesome ruins, especially Antelope House (with antelope pictographs running up side of cliff). Photos of R at Mummy Cave.  We asked at the visitors center before leaving on Thursday--Ledge House has been closed for 5 years because of vandalism and resident complaints; and the monument atop the hill across the bridge from the visitor's center supposedly is a survey monument of some kind, as we had suspected, although it is not accessible. 

Food: Junction Restaurant at Best Western. Breakfast: Junction "Blue" overlook (blue corn pancakes, 2 strips of bacon [not blue]); 2 eggs, chicken fried steak, frybread, home fries (R); coffee and cranberry juice.  Dinner: mutton stew for both, Navajo tortilla.  Lemonade and water. Saw "Ben", our guide (the father) at the Junction Restaurant in the morning!
