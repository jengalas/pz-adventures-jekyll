Breakfast around 8:00, then checked Cadillac Mountain Sports where R bought shorts.  Ride from Duck Brook Bridge to Halfmoon Pond, Breakneck Road to R's favorite spot where we rested, then tried to ride the rest of the road, crossing many times through the wet "isthmus" but we couldn't get past a large mucky spot, so we eventually turned back. Then we went down the west side of Eagle Lake to 8, then to 10, then 11, then past Aunt Betty Pond (remember winding roads with lots of wooden bridges that reminded me so much of Roosevelt State Park!), then to our spot on Eagle Lake to rest.  When the wind came up, the waves soaked us thoroughly! Rode back, went to Miguel's for supper, then drove up Cadillac Mountain looking for USGS chiseled marks; R found one on the way down. Then we went into town for the ice cream sampler.
