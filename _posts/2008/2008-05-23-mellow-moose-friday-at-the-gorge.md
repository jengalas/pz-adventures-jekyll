Great riding on this chilly late-May Friday. The river is high and fast (and probably cold!) today.  We saw a small snake near Rockport.

One of our usual break-spots is Buttermilk Falls, where Rich posed for a photo. I found out later that he was getting wet, and I'm sure it didn't feel quite as refreshing today as it would on a hot August afternoon!
