This morning I found the following Javascript "calculator" which displays the positions of the moons on any date and time between Jan. 1, 1900 and Dec. 31, 2100.  That's good enough for our needs right now, and it's quite handy.  It's also the source of the illustrations I've been using:

**10:30pm**

For the second night in a row, we've brought out the scope to explore Jupiter and the Galilean moons while relaxing on the patio.  We both are thrilled by what we can see (and intrigued by what we can't)!
