Food: After a failed attempt to find the Waterville House of Panca-akes we ended up at the _same damned McDonalds_ as last year (where we caused the coffee fiasco).  I had chicken selects (made with real breast meat) and R had a Southern Chicken Sandwich (made with real _chicken_ breast meat).  At night, of course we had Rosalie's pizza!  Plain this time with plenty of beer on the side.  Tons of bubbles in the pizza crust.  Dessert was a sorbet sampler at MDI Ice Cream: cranberry-lemon ice, star anise-grapefruit sorbet, lime-cucumber sorbet, and blueberry basil sorbet.

Got up at 5:00, tried to find REST with no luck.  It may be buried deeply, under rocks.  We were at Bean's by 7:20: remember the fish bowl dome!  We didn't do much else once we arrived, just rested (customary nap!) and went for dinner, and wandered around town a bit.
