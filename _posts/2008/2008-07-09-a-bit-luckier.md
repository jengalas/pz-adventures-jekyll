**10:30pm**

A very cloudy sky "miraculously" cleared just as I pulled into the driveway.  This time I had a view of Saturn and a quick glimpse of Mars, but only through the binoculars.  This was the first Rich had seen of them all night due to the clouds.  Jupiter, of course, rose large and bright over the haze!  Callisto and Ganymede appeared very close together tonight.

Cheese (sharp provolone) and crackers (stone-ground wheat) and beer (Victory Whirlwind) rounded out the evening quite nicely!

**4:00am (Thursday)**

The view wasn't terribly different this time:
