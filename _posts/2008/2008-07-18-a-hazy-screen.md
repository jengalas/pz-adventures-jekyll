**10:00pm**

Today was a relatively lazy summer Friday.  With heat and humidity so oppressive, we spent most of the day trying to stay still and cool.  Tonight we watched the movie "Toys" but ran outside halfway through to see what we could spot in the sky.  Jupiter was visible as usual, though quite dark and weak tonight through all the haze.  First we could see only Ganymede, but then the others became faintly visible one by one.  I was able to spot all four moons once or twice (while looking at Jupiter, rather than directly at the moons).  I think Rich only saw three tonight.

At 4:00am (Saturday), well, there might as well have been a wool blanket hanging over this town.  Couldn't see a thing through the soupy atmosphere.
