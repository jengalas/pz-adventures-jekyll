Checked out, stopped at visitors center (saw Ben again!), breakfast, stopped (somewhere -- look at map! for snacks), Hubbell Trading Post/prairie dogs, to Painted Desert visitor's center where we watched the movie, bought earrings and Route 66 hat at Fred Harvey store, then began visiting the overlooks.  Did all overlooks through Painted Desert Inn (Kachina Point--found BM) but then skipped the rest of the overlooks except Route 66 so that we could get to Puerco Pueblo in time for 2:30 ranger program. Hallie was the ranger and the talk was excellent.  Did Newspaper Rock, Agate Bridge, possibly one other overlook before going to visitors center at south end. Found out from Rita that we could basically hike anywhere we wanted as long as we weren't visible from designated trails and all four wheels of the car were to the right of the fog line.  Went to the Wigwam Motel in Holbrook where we got Wigwam #1 (closest to road, furthest from tracks that reviewers had complained about).  Went for supper at Joe & Aggie's. Got beer and snacks at Safeway and went to bed.

Food: Junction Restaurant: eggs, hamburger with gravy, biscuit (R);, scrambled eggs and bacon; juice and coffee.  Joe & Aggies: cheese crisps (ground beef and red chile sauce; chicken and hot green chile sauce), chicken taco, Dos Equis
