**10:30pm**

Tonight I came home to a very bummed Rich standing next to the spotting scope in the back yard.  He told me I had just missed (by two minutes) seeing Saturn!  It dipped down behind the trees the minute I pulled into the driveway.  He'd had an excellent, sharp view of it for about 45 minutes, in fact, until it entered the haze.  But if I'd been just a few minutes earlier, at least I would have caught a glimpse.  He said it was as if even Saturn conspired against me!

We did have a clear view of Jupiter and three moons:

**4:00am (Wednesday)**

And a view of all four at 4:00am:
