Tonight, just like last Wednesday, I left work two hours early so that we could visit the [observatory in Fleetville](https://www.keystone.edu/observatory/).  John Sabia was speaking on "Observing Planets with a Telescope." Just like Jo Ann's presentation last week, it was extremely interesting and informative.  We picked up some tips on how to proceed when we finally buy a real telescope, and we even learned about many features of the moon that we can easily observe now.  It was well worth the drive, even though (as usual) when we emerged after the presentation, the sky was completed clouded over.  As a bonus, John took us into the dome and spoke about the telescope for a few minutes, even though it was obviously pointless to try to use it tonight.
