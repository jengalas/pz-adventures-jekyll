**11:00pm**

As usual by the time I got home Saturn was nearly obscured by the haze, but I caught a few moments' worth of a shimmering, unfocused view.  It's a thrill no matter what!  I loved the first view we had tonight ... Io looks almost like "Bubble Rock" balancing on the edge of the planet!  Tonight we had the sharpest, steadiest view of the bands we've had yet.
