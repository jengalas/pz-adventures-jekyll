Monument Valley, UT/AZ

Food: Egg & government cheese sandwich, hash browns; 2 eggs, bacon, toast and pancakes with (!)margarine (R); juices and coffee; beef jerky and dried fruit; Hampton Inn: black bean soup with fry bread croutons, Navajo tacos for both, iced tea.

Notes: Horse on Highway!!!  No bath towels at Anasazi Inn - R: "Fred Harvey would be rolling in his grave!" and our attempts to get them.  Awesome drive around Monument Valley, stopped at many of the arts & crafts stands, ended up buying Kokopelli and turquoise turtle, John Ford's point and photo on horse!

"We followed our map across the country to find that where it showed the least, we found the most." Quote from old Goulding's guest book from a couple from Ardmore, PA.
