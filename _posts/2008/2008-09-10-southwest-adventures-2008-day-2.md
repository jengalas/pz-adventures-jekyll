<!-- Grocery store first thing.  Weber's IGA: amazing stuff, ice cream especially!  They had mango, green tea, and pomegranate Haagen Dazs ice cream, snack size Haagen Dazs bars, Blue Bunny banana split bars, acai berry sorbet (also Haagen Dazs), Blue Bunny gelato (and we couldn't have any of it because we had no freezer), thick-cut steaks and pork chops, pork loin, and unusual beers including the Oak Creek.  Then breakfast at the Red Rock Cafe: R: 2 fried eggs, turkey sausage ("dry"), hash browns with sweet potatoes, and seed bread (that he didn't care for but I loved), grapefruit juice, coffee.  Zh: multigrain pancakes, cranberry juice, coffee.  James Taylor song: Never Die Young.

Bell Rock trail (once we found it -- or did we?) in a monsoon hailstorm.  Dried off then tried Scheurman Mountain -- got lost, but eventually found the trail and the tri-station with storms looming and Rich very anxiously pacing and wanting to get out of there!  Drove the Red Rock Loop Road and saw some mansions ("invited guests only") and the bizarre menagerie.  Tried the Javelina Cantina for supper (sunset, hailstorm, rainbow!), enjoyed beer & bed.

R forgot to bring the GPS on the Scheurman Mountain hike, so we had to use Jill for coords.  They were reported as: N 34° 50.593' W111°50.168' (station); N 34° 50.590' W111°50.166' (RM1); N 34° 50.591' W111°50.172' (RM2).  We also recorded coordinates for the last trail cairn because it was so hard to find the correct trail (note: at this cairn, you have to turn 180° around and head up the hill; do not follow the trail straight!): N 34° 50.458' W111°49.910'. -->
