I was desperately in need of sunshine, fresh air and exercise, so Rich and I decided to check out the newest section of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail.  This is a short (approximately 1 mile) section between Meredith Street in Carbondale and the northernmost part of Mayfield.  It passes behind the old vo-tech school, which is now home to St. Rose Academy and a number of county offices.  Rich told me that did electrical work on the building a few times years ago, when it was newly constructed!
