We had so much fun at last night's program at Lackawanna State Park that tonight we decided to return to see the presentation of "Wild Pennsylvania," a series of photographs from state parks and forest lands across the state.  The show was excellent and lasted about an hour, until 10:00pm.  Of course the sky was free of clouds (though it was hazy) and we could see plenty of stars, and Jupiter led us home.

**10:30pm**

This is the most interesting configuration of moons we've seen yet!
