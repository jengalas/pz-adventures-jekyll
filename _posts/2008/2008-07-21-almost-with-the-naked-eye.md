**10:30pm**

Though he was working again tonight, Rich left the tripods, scope, and binoculars out for me so I could look at Jupiter after work.  Cloud cover was heavy during the day, but I was astounded how clear the southeastern sky became tonight!  This was one of the clearest, steadiest views I've had yet.  I could see all four moons through the binoculars with no effort at all; that's how clear and bright my view was.  And through the scope, it was even better.  The bands looked like they'd been drawn on the planet with a Sharpie marker.  It was a terrific view, but I missed being able to share it with my partner!
