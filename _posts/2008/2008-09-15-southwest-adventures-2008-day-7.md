Uninspiring breakfast, then went to Cliff Palace parking area to wait for our guide. We were early so we listened to the previous ranger, Bruce's talk before it was time for our tour. Our ranger was Angela, who was OK but Bruce seemed better. We learned about the construction of the sites and kivas, about the daily lives of the inhabitants, and about some of the controversies. The walk was not difficult, with some ladders and steps along the way. Then we went to the Balcony House tour. Cade was the ranger and the theme was technology (mostly corn). This was a shorter tour with high ladders, tunnels, steps up cliff face.  Really great, especially the high double ladder!  Then we did the Mesa Top Loop, stopping at all the sites along the way and even finding some unexpected BMs, the museum, and Spruce Tree House hike. Then we did the Far View sites before returning to our room to get ready for supper.

Breakfast: Metate Room: breakfast buffet (R); berries & yogurt parfait, tea, coffee, juice. "Name-tag set!"
Supper: Francisca's Restaurant in Cortez. Stacked enchiladas (beef, green sauce), sopapilla with honey; spicy burrito (chicken with red sauce) - R; pitcher of Tecate.
