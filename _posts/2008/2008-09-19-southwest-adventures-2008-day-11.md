<!-- Breakfast, back to wigwam and then to PF Rainbow Forest Museum to poop, FLATTOPS (spotted AZ MK first, then did INSANE hike to find the station and RMs, then got AZ MK), PAT, looked for PAT AZ MK for a long while without finding anything, DESERT PARK and AT&T tower, stopped at Jasper Forest, Long Logs Trail where I was burning up and had to put my jacket on, then went back to the museum to report our findings to Rita. Returned to wigwam, checked out El Rancho and Butterfield's Steakhouse, said no to both, ended up at Romo's; beer and bed!

Food: Joe & Aggie's: hotcakes, Country Crock Crap spread, bacon (R); scrambled eggs and bacon; juice and coffee; Romo's: shredded beef chimichanga (not fried) with green chile sauce and a chicken taco (R); bean and cheese burrito, chicken taco, sopapilla with honey; 3 Dos Equis. -->
