**10:30pm**

I had a decent view when I first arrived (not as good as last night, but close: I could see the 3 visible moons pretty easily through the binoculars).  But after about 20 minutes, it became too cloudy to see the moons or the bands on Jupiter.  And the large tree in Rich's back yard was getting in the way.  I had to move well out into the yard in order to continue watching the planet and moons.  I'm afraid we're losing our great views of our Summer friend!
