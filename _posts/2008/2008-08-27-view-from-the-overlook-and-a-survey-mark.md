I've known about this mark for years, but for one reason or another I never documented it.  A need to take a break from a hellish week at work gave me the inspiration to drive up to the overlook on this warm, humid evening.  I was left in peace for most of my time there, and I felt so much more relaxed by the time I returned to work.  Check out the new Moose-Mobile!
