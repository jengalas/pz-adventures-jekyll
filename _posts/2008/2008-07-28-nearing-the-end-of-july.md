**10:20pm**

Rich left the scope and binoculars outside for me again, and I stopped by after work for a quick look.  It wasn't too bad tonight overall, though there were some clouds and the bands weren't steadily clear.  All four moons were visible and in a pretty arrangement, sprinkled two on each side of the planet.  I could have stayed longer, but my eyes were so tired they were killing me.  It's so nice to be able to relax for a few minutes after work by watching the sky, but it's even nicer when Rich is home too, and we can enjoy a drink and a snack at the same time (as long as we don't drink so much gin & grapefruit juice that we might see 12 moons, as Rich feared on Saturday night!).
