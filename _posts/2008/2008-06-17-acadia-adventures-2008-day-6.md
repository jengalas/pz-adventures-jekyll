> "The sun will be out and the angels will be singing in Bar Harbor ... I can hear the Hosannahs now!"

We stayed in bed a little later than usual because it was raining. Once the rain let up, 2 Cats was our breakfast destination. The food was good, as usual, but the service was slow (also, as usual). Rich had pancakes, bacon, homefries, and coffee while I had an omelet with mushrooms, scallions, goat cheese, and Earl Grey tea. Good thing we were enjoying our food so much, because the atmosphere was frustrating due to a horribly annoying baby that was screaming, pounding on the table and kept dropping things on the floor. When we could hear anything, we noticed that a Suzanne Vega CD was playing in the background. 

Even though the weather looked to be threatening yet more rain, we decided to try going for a ride. We parked at Jordan Pond House and rode the following route (the numbers are taken from the signposts/intersections on the map): 15-10-8-7-17-37-36-38-17 and back to 15. We needed just a few more loops around the parking lot to make 13 miles. 

Our lunch was at Jordan Pond House: lobster rolls with grapes and chips, popovers with strawberry jam. Rich had a Bar Harbor Blueberry ale and I had blueberry tea.
