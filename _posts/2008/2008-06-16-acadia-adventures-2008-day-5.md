Breakfast from Morning Glory: lemon danish (R), coffee; orange/ginger/apricot scone, Earl Grey tea.  Supper: Red Sky: sweet onion jam on toasts, bread and whipped Cabot butter; lobster with pasta in cream & sherry sauce, parmesan crisp; Peekytoe crabcake with greens and lemon, garlic, & caper aioli. NY Strip Steak with Maytag blue cheese, onions, fennel with dill, scalloped potatoes with cheese (R); duck with green tea infused dried fruit (prune, apricot, cherry, raisin) compote, accompaniments as above; magical lemon cake with whipped cream, mint, blueberry sauce.

Began the day with a simple breakfast at our gazebo.  Then we documented 3320 E that we found on the steps on our way to the gazebo. Then we went shopping in town, R bought some pants, bandanna map, gin, milk.  Then after returning to the room, went for a little hike on Murphy's Lane: took left fork to pole 69, walked up Schooner Head Road to 72 where we reentered the woods and hiked back on the rest of Murphy's Lane. It was getting very misty by this time. We drove slowly along the Park Loop Road to tr to find the Cobble Beach, but it was raining too hard.  But we did find a neat spot overlooking Sand Beach and Great Head. Then we continued down to Otter Point, wondering about the BM that had been there, and then to Long Pond.  We were able to park at the bottom of some old carriage roads, now an access point to Long Pond that is private but the landowners allow access to the pond. We spent a lot of time looking for K 19 on a ledge.  We were sure we'd found the right ledge, but even with a metal detector we were unable to find the mark and after a long search, we had to give up.  Then we took a little walk on the Friends Path toward Long Pond.  Rich didn't want to attempt that many steps with his knees, so I ran down to get a view of the pond while he waited.  It was raining hard by this point.  Then we took a slow drive to Southwest Harbor and had a wonderful supper at Red Sky.  Back to the room early to rest!
