Fueled by quiche and grilled margherita sandwiches (and yes, a scone and a chocolate-iced vanilla cupcake) from nearby Zummo’s, Rich, Dad and I took an investigative stroll along the Scranton section of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. I’ve only hiked one small section of this part of the trail before, and at that time it was still more rail than trail! For the most part we were extremely impressed—both by the condition and beauty of the trail, and by how many people were out enjoying it in various ways.

We were nearly back to our car after a 6+ mile walk when Rich spotted an unusual object just off the trail and said “I think there’s supposed to be a geocache here.” A minute of poking and peeking around and we had found it.
