While enjoying a day of mountain biking on the Switchback Trail, Rich and I took a short detour from Summit Hill to search the area near the coordinates for any sign of the old Switchback chimney. We found a depression in the ground at the coordinates, and some bricks strewn around in the woods (but no evidence that the bricks came from the old chimney). Our NGS contact confirms that we positively identified the former location of the station, so it was officially marked Destroyed.
