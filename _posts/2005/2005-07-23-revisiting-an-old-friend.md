Rich, Aaron and I first spotted this mark while on our unintentional Fourth of July death walk around Cortez. Much too hot, sweaty and exhausted to consider examining it in any detail that day, we gave it little more than a glance. Rich and I returned a few weeks later to document the mark. It's one of the most recently set marks I've found, and it's in excellent condition. The mark is set into the east headwall of a new concrete bridge over Wallenpaupack Creek (West Branch) along Cortez Road.
