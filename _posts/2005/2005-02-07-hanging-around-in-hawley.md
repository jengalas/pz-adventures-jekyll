Rich and I both wanted to take advantage of the beautiful sunny morning, a rare Spring-like treat in early February, so we headed to Hawley in search of a geocache and possibly a nearby benchmark or two. With several inches of crusted-over snow still on the ground in most spots, I was concerned that we'd never find such a small container. Fortunately, the only problem the snow caused us was a perfectly synchronized slip & slide down the north side of the slope. :hushed:  We had some fun taking photos after finding and rehiding the cache and then went off to find and document a nearby USGS benchmark before calling it a day.
