We were lucky we got out to do _anything_ today, since the miserable weather we've been stuck with for a week held on for yet another day. In fact, had it been raining in the morning as it was toward the end of our adventures, I'm sure it would've been another full day spent sitting at home. With our intended trip to the Catskills out of the question due to such unpredictable conditions, our choices then were to head east to Sam's Point or the Shawangunk Ridge trail, or southwest toward Hickory Run and the gamelands across the river. East was a bad idea—even if the rain was gone, the persistent clouds and fog would make for less than optimal views—so the Hickory Run area won out.

We chose the back way through Bear Creek over the bleak journey along the Turnpike, and early in the morning the weather did show some promise of clearing up for us. We decided to hike the old railroad bed down to the Lehigh Gorge Rail Trail adjacent to the river, stopping for AN_OYSTERBOY cache and any other interesting diversions along the way. Even in the humid woods the conditions were pleasant and picturesque and I enjoyed every moment of the hike. We were enthralled by the old trestle abutment, and each ate way more than our share of Ice Breakers sour candies. :nauseated_face: 

After a short bushwhack through the open woods, we walked right up to the geocache. As I may have expressed earlier once or twice, after our experiences this summer with Beelzebub and RORRIM, I actually had to re-read the cache printout to assure myself that this was indeed an Oysterboy cache. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:  I traded nothing from the cache this time, although I was intrigued by the Rubik's cube-style puzzle inside.

The rest of the morning was spent exploring the other railroad bed in the area, poking around at the old trestle, watching the stream (which was quite full after the recent rain!) and just enjoying some nice conversation and those rare moments of peaceful silence we can only find in the woods. After finishing up at the gamelands, we had a choice between two activities at Hickory Run State Park: either searching for an old benchmark for which we had no datasheet, or navigating across the boulder field for both fun and exercise, as well as to check on an old favorite of ours, GeeOh's “Lost At Sea?” cache.

Well, on the long slow drive to the vast sea of stones, the sprinkles began again, and the rain soon followed. By the time we reached the parking area the rain was steady, though still light. After a fruitless search for a possible trail around the wet boulders, we headed straight across, first testing the rocks, which surprisingly weren't slippery at all. Rich's excellent memory (and his GPSr) led us right to the spot. The Indian guard is nowhere to be found, but the cache is still in place. It's wet inside, though, and the logbook is soaked through! Rich made a short note of our visit, being careful not to get the book any wetter; unfortunately because of the conditions we weren't able to dry out the contents at all and had to put everything back in the musty container wet as it was.

We swiftly skedaddled our way in heavier rain back to the parking area, where we briefly considered and then quickly discarded the idea of going for the Earthcache at this location. It was cold and we were wet and hungry. (I was particularly jealous of the two couples sharing a bottle of wine in the back of their SUV!)

From the list of nearby dining establishments in Rich's iQue, we identified “Franco's Pizzeria” in White Haven as a candidate for lunch. When we arrived we discovered that it is now called “Pancho's Pizzeria” and is a combination pizzeria and Mexican restaurant. It's bizarre, but it seems to work! The sausage pizza tasted great and had a nice thin crispy crust. I can't vouch for the Mexican fare since we didn't try it, but I have a feeling it would be quite authentic. We stopped at Bear Creek Falls along White Haven Road on our way home, and took a few photos ... very quickly because it was raining and I was frozen. We still haven't searched for the cache at that location.
