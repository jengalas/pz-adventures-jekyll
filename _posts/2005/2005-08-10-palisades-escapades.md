  Rich and I had a few tri-stations and geocaches in mind as possible diversions on our day-trip to the Palisades, but the main goal of the day was just hiking and exploring.

Started out at 6:45am
Reached State Line Lookout by 8:45am
Got everything ready, parking lot deserted
Couldn't decide which way to go, but finally chose to take the long route to the south and then come back and do the north there-and-back to the boundary marker if there was time
Headed to ROON
Hopped over the wall and right into the poison ivy,  Yikes!
First mark found was the station mark.  Easy to see as it was marked by a white cross for aerial surveying purposes.  
Then we set out to find RM1.  The distance and direction led us directly to a PI covered boulder.  Rich spotted the mark on the far end.  Originally he was going to avoid it altogether, but he managed to push enough of the vile plants aside that I felt comfortable hopping up on the boulder and taking some photos, and he soon followed.  After we both documented the station disk, we attempted to sight a bearing for RM2.  We didn't think we'd have much luck here; our route from the station woudl take us directly through a huge patch of poison ivy, and it wasn't only on the groudn but climbing the trees as well.  We eventually decided to exit to the road and try to re0enter the area from the other side of the stone wall, closer to where we expected RM2 to be located.  We were able to circumvent some of the PI but were not able to find the mark.  Perhaps in late Fall or Winter (still being careful of the PI vines, of course) we suspect we may have better luck.
Then took a cursory glance around for the drill hole, withotu having any great expectations and, as it turned out, without having any luck.  The boulders lining the east side of the road seem to have been either replaced by or built into a more solid stone wall.  Several of them have drill holes through, but there's no way of knowing which may have been the witness mark, if any.  None was at the precise location indicated on the datasheet.
Then began our hike.  
Went down the path I thought toward the castle, but we headed down the steep hill (slippery because it was so dry, we both skidded on the loose dirt a few times) toward the shore trail.  Along the way found the Alpine ski trail cache, didn't trade anything and managed to avoid the PI.
Then headed downward again, to the intersection where we turned left (north) and headed toward the "Giant Stairs".  Were going to take a break on the rocks, but they were boiling hot.  Rich didn't want to do the rock scramble and it really was too hot anyway.  At least I've seen it, and we can come back in the Fall.  
Retraced our steps and back to the intersection, then through a grove of berry bushes that looked like translucnet red raspberries and were sticky (didn't try them).  Wineberries?  
Path by the shore was alternately open (very hot in sun) and shaded by high weeds and bushes on the left (riverside) and trees/cliffs on the right.
Gentle walk with quiet conversation , found a shaded spot with natural stone "bench" and fireplace for our snack.  Dying of thirst by this point but also ate some sour licorice candies and Rich tried the violet candies (wasn't really a fan, said they tasted like old lady perfume).
Continued on along the path, found the Baywatch on the Hudson cache after quite a bit of searching.  Neat -- located inside part of an old foundation.
Then continued on (takgin a pee break in the PI along the way) somehow missed both piesr where we were going to look for two marks (suspected long gone).  Took a little "Bath" in a fancy stone culvert we found along the way.  Then made our way to the Alpine trail and back up to the top fo the ridge.  
Once at top, went under road just to check out the little tunnel, Rich sweated all over the rocks while a cyclist went by on the road.  Back through tunnel and started back up the trail, talking abotu McPhee and other interesting books.  
Made our way out this and that little trail to every overlook we could find.  Eventually found ourselves right near BURNETT!  Climbed through fence and out onto the cliff despite Rich's trepidation. :~)  He was pretty sure he knew it was on the far rock but didn't want to go out there, both because of the PI and because of the cliff.  I went out and found the cross immediately.  Rich came out too and we took our photos and just chatted for a while.  We then crossed back to the "legal" side of the fence and tried to spot some of the reference land,marks, without much luck.  We did find the power station, but that's about it.
then we continued north along the  trail and found two more neat overlooks -- remember "Dagny's View" and what Rich said about how this place always reminds him of Dagny looking out over the river down to the city skyscrapers from their Hudson estate.
Continued toward the Castle, found "don't miss the castle" along the way.  Didn't trade but found a nice log to sit and rest, where R was getting sleepy. :)
Played around at the castle for a while taking photos and just exploring.  Finally continued on, climbing some more since "High Point" is apparently not the high point of this ridge!  
Back at the oarking area (now somewhat busier), we were dying of thuirst having finished out drinks at Dagny's View earlier.  After cleaning up and changing, we bought 5 Snapples in the gift shop and drank them down while standing on the observatin platform in about 5 minutes!  Never drank anything that fast, never felt that good. Sunshine felt fabulous standing there with him looking out over the river, even though ti was almost unbearably hot.  
Where to go for supper?  R knew of a large mall about 10 miles away  we checked his IQue and what a surprise there was an Outbakc restaurant there.  Well, we had to go.  Got there without a problem but the GPS was pointing us to the Home Depot.  couldn't find outback.  Turned right and got sucked into the labyrunthine parking lot of the main entrance of the mall, and behind CUBEARS1.  Eventually turned left and found the hidden Outback restaurant *inside* the mall across from the Legal Sea Foods.  
Good dininer, lots of fun playing around with him and his foot and leg cramps.  Shrimp appetizer with "mustardy" sauce on brown bread.  Blue cheese chopped salad.  He had steak and sweet potato (cooked a little too long) and I had ribs which he loved.  Lots of great conversation and fun.
When done we were looking at the IMAX theater but decided it was too alte already to see a show.  "Hmm, it would be nice if there was a directory around here" "Uh, something like that, huge sign that says directory on 4 sides?!" He spotted the LEGO store!  Was unexpected treat wandering around the mall with himâ€”never though I'd be in a mall with him!  Got large bucket of pick-a-brick whiel he asked some questions about the various parts and looked around at the displays in the store.  Also bought some small polybags for cache prizes.
Some more wandering, but the mall was closing so we decided to leave.
Great ride home, listening to Beach Boys and Neil Diamond.  Nice hug too.
