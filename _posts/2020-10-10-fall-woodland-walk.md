Today was very warm and sunny, and we really wanted to spend some time outside on a photo walk. It has been a while since we checked on the Jack in the Pulpits at the State Park, so we made that our goal for the day. Looks like we were just a little too late, though. There was no sign remaining of most of the “Jacks.” Only one had a nice group of fruit still attached, but its stalk was bent and it was lying on the ground.

We walked the North Woods Trail toward Trostle Pond, hoping to check on the other Jacks in that area. They were also gone for the season, but we did spot a brightly colored pheasant on the trail near the pond.
