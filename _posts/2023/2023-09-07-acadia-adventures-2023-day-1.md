One theme for today and this past week (and month) - TIRED! Rich has been suffering sciatic pain for two weeks and it hasn't improved much.  In the meantime neither of us has been sleeping very well. Today was similar; we planned to leave very late, around midnight, and sleep during the day but I don't think I got more than 5 minutes' rest last night or today. I had a feeling the drive was going to be an ordeal.

The first part of the drive was fine, with very little traffic. There was quite a bit of road work along I-84 (and, as an aside, a large truck fire on I-84 westbound near the Connecticut border) and that slowed us down and made the traffic accumulate a bit but once we cleared the area the traffic thinned out again.

We were very tired when we reached the Charleton Plaza on the Mass Pike just after 4:30am. We washed up and had a brief moment of panic when we looked at our email confirmation and saw that it specified only 13 nights and not 14 as we had asked for and planned for.

We went back to the car to get some rest. As I lay down I had a vague memory of having seen the incorrect confirmation, calling the hotel manager to sort it out, and not receiving an updated confirmation but noting that the amount charged to our credit card was correct for 14 nights, so we figured that was enough. We still couldn't be srure until we found a trustworty wifi connection to check our old credt card statements.

We rested until about 6:30 and then headed out. Wow, the roads were absolutely insane by this point. The worst stretch was 290 and 495, my most-hated roads of all time. Just pure insanity. Things improved a little but by the time we got to I-95, and most of I-95 through Maine was fine. I was driving this stretch to let Rich relax a little.

I intended to drive all the way to Young;s Lobster Pound in Belfast, but stopped just a few miles before that as we were getting low on gas. Rich filled up at the Shell station and then he took over the driving from there, and we arrived at the lobster pound just before 11:00am.

Our lobster rolls were amazing as alwasy, veyr filling and a most welcome breakfast because my belly had felt empty since at least 3:00am. The place was busy too, much busier than I had ever seen it. In years past there may have been one or two other couples there, and at least once we had hte place entirely to ourselves. It was sunny, warm and relatively humid, and breezy by the water.

Speaking of the water, there were three large yellow "rubber duckie" statues(?) floating near the bridge. They were labeled Joy, Greater Joy, and Greatest Joy from smallest to largest. Very strange and amusing art installation, if that's what it is.

We were very tired and sleepy and didn't want to spend too much time poking aroud today, but I did want to search for the 43 Bangor 1899 benchmark n the Buck Memorial Library in Bucksport that we missed out on last year (because I didn't know about it until I got home). it was a very easy find on the steps of the library and the picturesque library building made for some nice phots. We didn't stay long, heading toward Bar Harbor and arriving just before 2:00pm hoping to check in early.

Before anything else, we wanted to check out credit card statements to see i we had indeed paid for 14 nights. Our wifi password from last year worked and we were able to verify the informaion while sitting on the porch of the room we were about to check into.

A sign greeted us at the desk reminding guests that check-in was at 3:00pm, so initially we were irked and disappointed that we might have to wait another hour (both being very tired and in need of a nap!). Fortunately the woman working at the desk this afternon came by within a few minutes and said that we could have the room as soon as she checked it over.

We brought our stuff inside and collapsed for about 30 minutes until the pull of pizza and a LARGE glass of beer was stronger than the pull for more sleep. (That was a _strong_ pull!) We were at Rosalie's by 3:55 and began the line, and were the first ones in the door. We got the first booth, our usual favorite, and Rich ordered us our usual first-night medium pie and two large Allagash white ales. Conversation was as good as always, listening to the good music in Rosalie's and talking about some interesting music-related videos that Rich had seen. We watched one of the videos when we got back to the room (after aquick trip to Hanaford) and then collapsed into bed.
