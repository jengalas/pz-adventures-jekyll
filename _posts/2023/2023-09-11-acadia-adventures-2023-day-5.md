The day began very humid and cloudy, with a threat of rain in the air and on the radar, but weather conditions along the coast are very changeable and unpredictable. It was worth trying to hike regardless, because it was warm and I planned to stay on mostly level ground (at least, I wouldn't attempt anything like the crazy climbs and descents of the Black and White path).

As always, first we had breakfast. Neither of us was very hungry, so I just walked down to Mount Dessert Bakery for a few treats. FOrtunately I was third in line, and they had exactly what we wanted: croissant, pecan sticky bun, and blueberry hand pies for later in the day. We ate on the porch as usual, and discussed where we might like to explore.

Turns out I went back to the same area today, exploring near Beaver Dam Pond again, just to see what else I might find-might as well explore thorougly while I can! I started into the woods at hte same hidden "trailhead" I used yesterday, thinking I might find a connection between it and the bicycle path. I didn't find anything all that distinct, just a few faint trails, but it's open woods and only about 100 feet between the paths, so a connector isn't really necessary. I just worked my way over to the bucycle path and continued on my way north, around the Beaver Dam Pond toward the Park Loop Road.
 
I didn't see too much along the way, but it was still a lovely day for a hike in spite of the soggy conditions. Hiking an abandoned trail in the rain pretty much guarantees you won't see anyone else! And I didn't, at least not until a bit later.

I wanted to take the old steps (once part of the Black and Blue Trail) from the bicycle path up to the Champlain North Ridge trail, and hike a bit of the North Ridge Trail just to see what conditions were like up there. I figured it would be foggy, but still thought I might be able to catch a bit of a view. So I climbed up, and on my way up it was actually pretty dry. It wasn't raining at the time, and the rocky slopes were mostly dry so I felt safe enough climbing for a while.

It was nice to get some exercise on a steep trail, and I haven't hiked this one in a while so I enjoyed being reminded of its twists and turns. But as I climbed higher, it began to mist again, and soon became a bit heavier. Two young women passed me, going down, warning me that it was very slippery. I didn't plan on going all the way to the summit anyway (I was about half a mile away) and this seemed lke a good point to turn around.

I stepped my way down slowly and iddn't have any problems, but the rocks and slabs were becoming wetter so it was going to be treacherous pretty soon. I took the Black and Blue steps back to the bicycle path and the bicycle path out to the Park Loop Road, where I crossed over to look for Dorr's granite quarry. Interesting ting is that it's right there, butting up against the road, althouhg you wouldn't know it because it;s just not visible over the high bank. Unfortunately it began to rain heavier when I was there and I wanted to explore the quarry with Rich anyway, so after taking a few quick photos I turned around and headed back on the bicycle path.

I was soaked by the time I got back, but still excited by the walk and the discoveries I've made in this area. I can't wait to share them with Rich!

We spent the rest of the afternoon researching and reading in our room befre heading to dinner at anew French restaurant in town Brasserie Le Brun. ("Is the 'Brown's' doormat what inspired the name?" Rich wants to know.) It is apparently owned by the same people as Havana and it was excellent. Inside a former spa it has beautiful high ceilings and blue walls with white trim, and just a breezy modern feel inside. They lpayed various types of French music (everything from some sort of French rock/rap to the Champs Elyses song). And the food was amazing! We shared everything so we each had a taste of a few different things. We started with cocktails: French martini (vodka and pineapple) for R and a "sage advice" for me (gin & tonic with sage and blueberries). Then starters were the french onion soup and a tarte tatin, both of which were amazing. Then our entrees were large, tender scallops with toasted farro, and steak frites. The steak was tender and beefy with a light butter sauce, and the fries were served with a delicious vinegar sauce (and ketchup, of course). We barely had room for dessert but wanted to try the butterscotch creme brulee with toasted hazelnuts, which was so creamy and delicous. It would have gone so well with coffee, but we didn't have room for another bite or sip of anything.
