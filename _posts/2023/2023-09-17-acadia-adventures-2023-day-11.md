## Fern Trail or Kittredge Brook?

After being unable to go for anything for supper last night due to the storm, I was looking forward to somethig a little more filling this morning, and I had been thinking about those Eggs Benedict at hte Black Friar all week. So we headed down there for opening time at 7:30. 

The place was pretty quiet initially, with only one other couple waiting. But it filled up quickly. Fortunately the noise level stayed pretty tame. And the Eggs Benedict were delicious, just what I had remebered from last year. I got the version with grilled portobello mushroom, and Rich got the one with baby spinach (we each tasted a bit of each other's, of course).

We came back to the room to find that the internet connection was still down from this morning. Not a big deal as it was going to be a warm, beautiful sunny day and we planned to go out and do somethig for most of the day. But we had trouble deciding what to do!

We were looking for a place where I could explore and Rich would be comfortable sitting and reading for a while, and poking around and doing some gentle walking if he was in the mood. My only thoughts were going back to Bear Brook picnic area so I could continue exploring Huguenot Head and Champlain, maybe going to the Fabbri picnic area from where I could explore the Otter Cove trail and Gorham Mountain, or maybe doing something near Asticou/Thuya Gardens.

Rich's suggestion was to explore the Kittredge Brook Preserve behind the MDI High School. The map we have doesn't show it very clearly, and at first glance it honestly didn't look all that exciting. I don't know why, but from the map it looked like the kind of trail that encircles athletic fields and wastewater ponds - fine for dog walking or for getting a run in before work, but not what I would consider hiking.

Boy, was I wrong! We parked behind the high school and were relieved to find a convenient wooden picnic table there for Rich to use while I explored the area.

I passed by the pond (yes, a wastewater pond) and ascended the first hill to, yes, an athletic field. But then I entered the woods and the scenery and my mindset changed completely.

This place was remote, rugged, rustic, and beautiful! Right frm the beginning it reminded me of hiking an abandoned trail, even though it was quite well taken care of and very well marked. I didn't see anyone else the entire time, and I passed through so many cobwebs crossing the trail that it didn't seem that anyone had used the trail in quite some time.

Also abundant were the NPS boundary markers. (I didn't realize it until I looked at the map later, but one part of the loop follows a park boundary, and part of the loop is actually within the boundary of the park.)

Soon after the first intersection, I came to another with a sign indicating that the northernmost loop trail was closed ... but only between the months of March and August. So I figured it was fine for me to try it.

That loop was very different from the first, and both nasty and beautiful in its own way. The trail is mostly a soft pine-needle covered treadway through pine and spruce woods ... with blowdowns everywhere you looked. It was a strange balance between soft easy walking and stepping over sharp snags every other step. But overall I loved the peacefulness of this area, and the challenge of picking my way through the labyrinth. This section was almost like following an abandoned trail. Even though there were blazes, sometimes while crossing the areas of large blowdowns I lost the trail for a moment and had to look around to find where it continued.

After that loop, I came back to the intersection and decided to head north on the straight out and back section for a bit just to see what it was like. There are so many bogwalks in this section (although there are many bigwalks throughout the preserve)! It passes over higher ground with lichen-covered ledges, and then straight down into seas of sphagnum that, right now after such a rainy year and a hurricane, have swifly flowing creeks through them.

I turned around after less than half a mile, just wanting to get a taste of what it was like. There's plenty more here to explore.

I took the western half of the first loop back to the car. This section was quite a bit wetter than the eastern side, and features a nice long bogwalk. (One thing to note about many of the bogwalks in this preserve, although not the really long one, is that they are covered with a fine wire mesh to provide traction. It works very well on the otherwise super-slippery-when-wet logs.)

Another suggestion Rich had while we were driving to the high school was to ask if I had anything to check out in the area of the Duck Brook Bridge. I did, in fact! I had seen that there was supposed to be part of the abandoned Sweet Fern trail that could be entered right from across the bridge, basically paralleling the carriage road but more level and of course, devoid of people. I followed the trail (which was wet, again due to this year's conditions) out to the carriage road, then crossed over it, and went west a few feet to find where the trail picked up again (it eventually emerges on Paradise Hill Road, just southeast of the Witch Hole Marsh trail that we often use to get into this area, although I dind't follow the full trail today). I took some videos of the wild water passing through the culvert in this location, and then took the carriage road back to the Duck Brook Bridge just to compare that route with the trail. (It is steeper and, although dry, not as pleasant to walk.) I took some more photos and videos of the rushing water while at the bridge, and even found a small frog who, unlike his buddy that hopped away as soon as I came near, was willing to pose for some photos.

I followed a small trail from beneath the bridge right back to the road, where Rich picked me up.

Neither of us was very hungry, so dinner was the usual light standby - a small house veggie pizza at Rosalie's! Along with two large Allagash Whites, of course. We lingered a long time over the beers and good conversation, and then took a walk up the street to check out the menu for the Thai and Indian restaurants (one of which we may try tomorrow) and get an ice cream cone at MDI Ice Cream. Rich got the Callabaut Chocolate and I got a blueberry basil sorbet. Excellent, and finally a nice warm evening to sit at the Village Green.
