## Little Long Pond? Land and Garden Preserve?

We got a later-than-usual start this morning, and to my mild surprise Rich wanted a little something more for breakfast. So I picked up a plain croissant and an almond croissant from Mount Dessert Bakery, plus one of their sticky buns for later, because I just can't resist them. And I do have a lot of willpower.

Rich procured the drinks and a blueberry muffin, just in case, while I went to the bakery, and we ate on the porch as usual. It was shaping up to be a beautifully warm, sunny day. I liked his idea from yesterday about going to the Little Long Pond/Friends Path area, so that's what we did.

Parking was tight but Rich found one remaining spot along the southern edge of the lot. He decided to poke around near the parking lot in case he needed to return to the car quickly to sit, while I would take a longer walk to check out the rest of the "snake trail" we found last year.

The carriage roads were beautiful as always, and although the parking lot was busy, I saw very few people on the trails. A red squirrel was stealing green cones from the carriage path and running off with them behind atree, only to emerge a few seconds later for another one. I took a few photos (did not have a long lens) while he comically eyed me and squawked, and ran up and down the tree.

In less than a quarter mile I came to the beginnign of what we called the Snake Trail. I followed it through the forest, and then up onto a lichen-covered ledge, then descended to the spot where I saw the snakes last year. No snakes there this year! I even did my "come out, little snakes" call that actually seems to get our garter snakes at hoem to emerge, but no luck.

I continued on down the trail, which enters deep woods at a a lower elevation and is a well-defined path completely surrounded by lush green moss. There were some wet areas here, but surprisingly few given the amount of rain we've had recently.

The path curved toward the left/south, and at one point I spotted a spider web crossing the path in front of me. I took the top thread and released it so I could pass through. As I went to attach it to a nearby shrub, I glanced down and spotted a beautiful juvenile garter snake! So the snake call did work! :grin:

The snake was most likely asleep when I first saw him. He let me get close and didn't indicate that he sensed me at all. Then slowly he moved his head and gave a few tongue flicks. Still no startled motion, and he stayed on the bed of moss in the sun. I was able to take as many photos as I wanted, and spent quite a long time with him. Eventually he moved off slowly toward his log as I got up to move down toward the end of the path, just a few hundred feet more, ending at someone's back yard and denoted with a sign saying "Doug's Way." I turned around and made my way back. When I passed the snake's spot, he was no longer visible.

I went back to teh carriage roads and did a nice loop including the West Meadow path, part of the David and Neva Trail, and then took the Friends Path back to the car, where Rich was waiting. He had taken some photos around the parking area and had walked up the carriage road a bit to the "octopus tree" we photographed here last year.

I had to spend 5 more minutes looking for the USGS bench mark in this area that we haven't been able to find. Still no luck this time.

I was thinking that, if Rich felt better, I could take him to the Tilting Rock. I would love for him to see it, after knowing about it all these years but never seeing it. But it seemed that would be a better activity for a time when he could enjoy it more, so we'll leave it for next time.

Our first thought was to take a drive up toward Jordan Pond House. SOmehow we didn't realize it was 12:00 on the dot and it would be completely full with the lunch crowd (and hiking and biking crowds). There was no room in either lot, so we moved on and headed back around on Route 3 toward our other idea for the afternoon, which was to check out Northeast Harbor. We haven't spent any real time there in a few years, so we were due anyway.

The town was busy without a single parking place to be found anywhere, so we headed over to the marina. Right around this time we both realized that we were hungry, and there happened to be a food truck in the parking lot. It was busy and looked interesting so we checked it out - "The Bucking Lobster." They had a simple but delicious sounding menu of lobster rolls, lobster quesadilla, and lobster tacos. We just couldn't resist the lobster tacos! We got one order of two: tender lobster, slaw, and lime crema on corn tortillas. It came with tortilla chips and absoutley delicious salsa that I ended up drinking the rest of after the gusty wind blew my last tortilla chip away. We ate at one of the dozen or so picnic tables under a shade tree nearby, and it was nearly the perfect setting (minus the gusty wind). 

After finishing up the tacos (and having a hard time resisting buying about 6 more) we wandered down by the docks, where Rich took some photos of the marine happenings.

A couple hours spent cleaning up and resting in the room, and then it was time for our last meal here.

We had been planning all along to celebrate our last night here - and, coincidentally, National Pepperoni Day - with a pepperoni pizza ("Pizzaroni!") from Rosalie's. We got a medium this time, figuring we could save two slices for tomorrow, and the medium would give us another token. The sign indicated that we would only need 6 tokens for a free pizza, so we might actually be there, or close to it, now! Will have to keep that in mind for next year, and make sure that I bring all of the tokens we've collected.

Arriving at Rosalie's about 10 minutes before opening time, we were very surprised to see about 10 people already lined up there. Most times we've come there have been a few other people waiting, although we were usually first, sometimes second. This was bizarre! They were all older peopel and I suspected that maybe a tour had just let out, or something, but they didn't seem at all acquainted with each other. 

And it was competitive! I wanted to secure our usual corner table on the second floor, but the first woman in the door went up there so fast it was like she was shot out of a rifle. And of course she took that table. I bypassed another woman on the steps (who also appeared to have wanted that table) and grabbed the table in the other corner. Whew! Almost too rich for my blood, but like I said to Rich, these people have been sharpening their elbows in supermarket aisles for 50 years, so I have some catching up to do.

Despite all the people ahead of us, the pizza still came out pretty quickly. This time we had Baxter Lager to go with it. And as expected, it was a perfect ending to a wonderful trip.

But the pizza wasn't quite the end of the evening for me. I had planned to pick up a bottle of local wine for my father from Hannaford, but it turns out they didn't have anything other than a sparkling blueberry wine. I might try it, but it sounds sweet, and in any case wouldn't be something my father would take to dinner with his friends. Now what to get? I went back into town and stopped at one of the Acadia shops for some Jordan Pond House strawberry jam, because you can't really go wrong with that. And then I walked down to the only other place I know of that sells wine, House Wine near McKay's. I don't think I've been in there before. It looked like a nice shop with an extensive array of wines, and even a few cheeses. I asked about locally made dry wines and found them right in the front of the store. I got a dry pear wine from Bartlett (which we've had before) and "Sieur de Monts" Sangiovese from Bar Harbor Cellars.
