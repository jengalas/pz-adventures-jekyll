We woke up to another very nice day (still very humid, but not foggy like yesterday) and, unfortunately, still pain in Rich's leg. I brought back a blueberry muffin and some coffee and juice for him from the hotel lobby so he could take medication; I had planned on going to the Flowered Apron but since that doesn't open until 8:00, we had some time to wait.

I headed over there around 7:45 and arrived just a few minutes before the shop opened, taking the shortcut through the cemetery. (In fact I walked down to the end of the street just so I wasn't bothering them before they opened, and saw Steve placing the "pop up bakery" sign at the corner of Cottage and Kennebec.) 

All of their baked goods looked great, but I knew we would be mostly interested in the savory offering, which was a cheddar scallion biscuit. I bought two, in fact, even though they were pretty big. I also got a molasses-ginger cookie (which I've had before and it was awesome), a three-pack of lemon tea cookies, and a chocolate raspberry cupcake. The featured item for today was a chocolate raspberry cake, and while the slices looked delicious (two chocolate layers filled with raspberry cream and topped with chocolate ganache) I knew it was more than I could handle this morning! So I opted for the cupcake. 

The business is self-serve now, and I didn't see Karen at all, but Steve was roaming around outside setting up the various signs. I fit everything into a box, paid, and walked over to the Island Explorer building to pick up a few bus schedules before heading back to the hotel. (At the hotel, I also procured a few slices of butter to spread on the biscuits, and some more juice and coffee.)

While we ate, we looked for another simple activity that would give Rich plenty of opportunities to rest while I explored. I knew that there were a few trails to explore near the Bear Brook picnic area and we figured that might be a nice place to park and use as a base for the day. 

Rich came along on my first exploration of the connector path between the picnic area and Jackson Labs, which was a short trail, not overly exciting, but still something to add to our map. In addition we found two NPS boundary markers along this short path. Rich didn't make it quite the whole way before his leg started bothering him, so he headed back toward the picnic area. This gave us a chance to test out our new radios, which worked quite well. I've often wanted to have something for communication when I go off scouting an abandoned trail, and cell phones still get horrible reception on the island, so radios it is.

Rich got settled in with his book at one of the picnic tables, and I headed off to see if I could find any traces of the old Black and White path that went from the Beaver Dam Pond up, eventually, to Champlain summit via the saddle between Champlain and Huguenot Head.

Entering the woods at a point I had marked 8 years ago, I followed a path we had taken all those years ago when we originally found the bicycle path. After just a short distance, I spotted what appeared to be an intersection with a trail heading south—the basic direction I was looking for. 

I began to follow it and almost immediately spotted a cairn! And then another, and another. There were some sections of quite obvious trail here, and I was getting more and more excited. 

But after one particular cairn, all traces of the path seemed to stop. I searched all over, following a rocky drainage quite far up the hill, and going back to the last cairn and looking off to either side, back and forth, without ever spotting another cairn or sign of the trail continuing. It was difficult even to tell where I was on the tiny screen of the GPS. 

I decided to descend again, back to the original trail, and follow it toward the Beaver Dam pond, where the Black and White trail is supposed to have begun, to see if I could find anything else. 

And when I got closer to the pond, I did spot another cairn on the other side of the outlet stream! I crossed over and followed a faint trail to another cairn or two and then ... nothing. I poked around in this area too but couldn't find anything else of interest. I suspect that these cairns meet up with the others I found earlier in some way.

I didn't want to take too long, and it was very humid and wet inside the woods, so I called Rich on the radio and told him about what was happening. I poked around for just a few more minutes and headed back to the picnic area, thinking that I would like to view my tracklog and waypoints on the map before I try again. 

At least I found a small frog and several areas filled with rattlesnake plantain!

We had been undecided all day about what to have for supper, and neither of us was very hungry. We both, however, were craving a small house veggie pizza and a tall beer! So it was back to Rosalie's (where a line had already formed by 3:55pm). We sat at a table upstairs today to enjoy better lighting. Although there were a few large groups seated upstairs, it didn't get too loud until right when we were ready to leave. (There is apparently an inverse relationship between the level of beer in the glasses, and the level of noise in the room!) 

The pizza was delicious, filled with veggies which we need and were craving, and the beers (Allagash white ale again) were very refreshing after our adventures on this warm and humid day. There was just enough room in our bellies for a baby scoop of ice cream: maple pecan for Rich and blueberry basil sorbet for me. Rich seemed to feel a little better tonight walking quickly rather than slowly as he had been doing, so we'll see.
