My father invited us to join him this morning for a drive to Montrose for the annual Blueberry Festival and a breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes. This was an offer too good to pass up! I haven't been to the blueberry festival in years, but I always thought it was fun. As a bonus, I discovered that there was supposedly a bench mark set into the courthouse foundation. Of course, after the pancakes were eaten (and after a blueberry pie, cactus pup, and Susquehanna County history book were purchased), finding the bench mark became our priority, and we were thrilled to see that it was accessible.

Following this exciting morning, we spent some time hiking the Penny Rock Trail at nearby Salt Springs State Park. The Penny Rock geocache was one of the first ones I ever placed (and probably one of the first in Susquehanna County). It was adopted by another Geocacher, pendotron, in January of this year. Because it's now in a new location and a new container, Rich and I felt that it would be kosher for us to search for it and log another fine. We did so, and enjoyed our leisurely walk along the wooden boardwalks high above the falls.

We ended the day's adventures with another benchmark find, this one set in the front yard of a home in Lenox Township.
