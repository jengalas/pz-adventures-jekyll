For Dad's second full day with us, we decided to skip the sit down breakfast and get something quick before heading to Blue Hill for the day.  And hey, we had to leave room for lunch at El El Frijoles!  We took another chance on Morning Glory, both dad and I hoping beyond hope that sanity had been restored to the universe and their sinful sticky buns were again available.  No such luck. What's going on with this place?!  Their Earl Grey cookies are awesome, but I don't really want them for breakfast, and the other sweet items were cakes and cookies of other varieties, not a breakfast pastry in sight. So we ended up with bagels that nearly caught the toaster on fire. Oh, and it works better if you slice the bagel _before_ toasting it! Their spicy cilantro cream cheese is still pretty awesome, anyway.  And the scenery while we ate at the gazebo was colorful as always, and dad liked seeing the fog-free view of the harbor.

Getting off the island and onto the peninsula - retracing our route from last Thursday, we drove north, back through Ellsworth and then west onto the Blue Hill peninsula, and into the town of Blue Hill.  We parked at the second (west-most) parking area, which we hadn't been able to see from Google Satellite view but which was very obvious at the site. it's really just a shoulder pull-off, but there's plenty of room for five or six cars at least. We hiked the "easy to moderate" Osgood Trail to the summit. This trail features lots of roots and rocks and some steep sections, several of which are traversed by sets of stone steps - not exactly comparable to the construction standards of the CCC's Perpendicular Trail, but still a great effort - with apparently more to come - from a volunteer organization, the Blue Hill Heritage Trust. The only disruption to the peacefulness of this trail were the several dogs off-leash. The trail is heavily wooded with lots fo deadfall and evergreen "skeletons" nearby, so not the most scenic woods. But the summit is well worth the walk! It opens out

Little Deer Isle, meeting Peter and our contact with him afterward, lighthouse (pumpkin island) - viewed from shore, and then BILLINGS RESET. Light supper back at Rosalie's.

We rounded out the day's adventures with two more triangulation station recoveries (LITTLE DEER ISLE RESET and BILLINGS RESET) and awesome Maine-Mexican fusion cuisine—lobster tacos and burritos and blueberry agua fresca—at nearby El El Frijoles.Thanks for showing us an even better view, and for the exciting add-on adventure!
