Rich and I usually enjoy making breakfast at home and relaxing together in the morning. But sometimes we crave something different, and we appreciate when someone else does the cooking and makes the coffee. On this humid May morning we met my father at Zummo's Cafe (home of Electric City Roasting Company's Blue Moose coffee!).  On our table: a bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich for each of us; berry scones for me and dad; and Blue Moose and Brazilian coffee for dad and Rich, and Earl Grey for me. (I don't do coffee except on rare occasions.) 

The rain showers we expected never materialized, so after breakfast the three of us drove to Lake Scranton for a leisurely 3.5-mile walkâ€”along with half of Lackawanna County, I think.  It's been a long, cold winter.  

While rounding the southern end of the lake, on a long concrete bridge wingwall near the dam, I spotted a small disk which is undoubtedly some sort of survey marker.  It's stamped LAKE SCRANTON W.W., which we assumed stands for "water works". 

There is a similar disk, LAKE SCRANTON PAV., on the opposite end of the lake, at an overlook that was once a [pavilion](https://www.flickr.com/photos/camerashi/2514313451/in/photostream/) (now only the base remains).  Rich and I found that mark over ten years ago.  This one looks to be as old, so I wonder why we never noticed it before.  It provided a good opportunity to test the camera on my new phone.  (Verdict: eh ... but there are many settings that I haven't yet explored.)
