Day of relaxation for mooses! Baker Island cruise was canceled yet again due to rough seas. It was cold and extremely windy this morning; even the strong sunshine took hours to warm up the air to a noticeable degree. We ended up sitting for a while by the waterfront while we watched a man dressed as an Indian, carrying snowshoes, walk onto the beach, stand around looking at the water, and take a few selfies before strolling back up onto the pier and disappearing; getting a second tea (for me, blueberry black) and one for R (cranberry black); and doing a bit of shopping in Shermans and the Acadia Shops. Then we returned to the room and ate the cheese and crackers that were supposed to have been our snacks on Baker Island. 

While we were catching up on a few things in the room, I happened to notice a review on TripAdvisor about a bagel place in town that we had never heard of—the Bagel Factory—and this really appealed to both of us, especially Rich! So we set off immediately to find the bagel place, thinking it would make a really nice lunch. We were also intrigued by the mentions in the reviews of Agnes, the bagel baker, who is supposedly a really interesting character who has great stories to share. Neither of us had even heard of Cadillac Ave., where the shop is located. All we knew was that it was near the bike shop, down the end of a gravel road/alleyway in an old house that looked nothing like a business at first glance.

Our first turn was into an unnamed gravel alleyway. We saw nothing at all at the end of it and were turning around when a man called to us from an upstairs window in the building close by. "Are you looking for the bagel place?" he said. "Next street over. I get at least 20 people a day looking for the bagel place!" 

We thanked him and moved on to the next street. We found the place all right, but for some reason it was closed today even though it is apparently normally open on Fridays. As we were leaving a youngish woman came through the alleyway, keys in hand, striding toward the door of the shop. Could this be Agnes? As soon as she saw the Closed sign, she turned around to return to her car parked on the street. "I guess you're not Agnes," Rich said. "Ha-ha! No," she laughed, "she's like 85 years old."

Rich was devastated! He had so been looking forward to bagels as a snack or lunch, and I admit that I was too. We'll try again on Sunday, or Saturday morning if the Baker Island cruise is canceled yet again. We came up with a backup lunch plan of Side Street Cafe, and simply splitting a lobster roll and beer, which was perfect. We had a Switchback Ale, lobster roll and fries. That was plenty of food to fill us up for a while.

By now it was noon and time to go back to the room and rest a while longer (hey, it is vacation, right?!). We took one nap together, and Rich took a second one while I was working on a few benchmark pages. 

Then we wandered down to the village green, where we sat in the sun again (it was much warmer, and calmer, by now) and worked on our LITTLE DEER ISLE RESET recovery note for NGS. We wandered around town again, poking in a few shops here and there, and bought a small square pot for a small cactus.

We investigated the new tapas bar at Havana after making a reservation at the main restaurant for tomorrow night. Then we moved on to Mache Bistro for an awesome meal!


Tonight's dinner at Mache Bistro:
Dogfish 90 minute IPA and ?(Ask R what he had)
Three Goats Cheese Plate: Vermont double cream aged goat cheese, Vermont Bonne Bouche ash aged goat cheese and French aged Bucheron goat cheese served with spiced honey & crab apple mostarda
Lamb Sausage Duo: Grilled Rosemary Lamb Sausage & Merguez Sausage served with a white bean dip and grilled flatbread
Grilled Northeast Fisheries Hook & Line Atlantic Swordfish served over saffron orzo topped with a sun-dried tomato pesto
Cabernet Poached Pear with blackberry cabernet sorbet

After this perfect meal, we stopped at Hannaford-Bananaford for a few items for the morning (apple turnovers, yogurt) and a few other provisions.
