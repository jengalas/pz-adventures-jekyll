Great day, of course! Got an early start, around 5am. Went to Bean's first, there by 6:40am, and did some shopping and trying on of items. Rich first tried on some water shoes but he needed a size 13 (much larger than usual) and they were not in stock. Rich was able to get his jacket replaced since the lining had worn out.  Saw golden salmon, enjoyed taxidermy display with opossum, fisher, moose(!), skunk, fox. 

Second stop was, much further up the road, Fort Point SP again. We expected it to be low tide and thought we might just have a chance at accessing the mark that last year was completely surrounded by water at high tide when we arrived at the park. First, we found D 147, which we weren't able to access last year due to the rain (and foot of water in the ditch) and possible poison ivy. This year Rich beat down a path right to the boulder, through dry brush this time, and no visible PI. We were able to confirm that the disk is D 147, as we had expected. 

We then continued along Lighthouse Road, past a few seaside "cottages" that we would have loved as a summer home, toward the lighthouse and a different entrance to the state park than we had used in the past. We parked under an apple tree (mmm, the scent of fermenting apples :grimacing:), paid our entrance fee and hiked down toward the pier and beach. To our great delight, the boulder was completely out of the water! With some coaxing, and to the delight of Rich and nearby German tourists, I climbed up on top—we both knew all along that I _would_ eventually do it!—and was able to confirm that the disk was Tidal No. 2. This confirms what we had suspected, but couldn't prove, last year. It still doesn't really help with finding Tidal 3 or 30, though. 

Next was the Bagaduce Lunch!  It was even better than last year. We got a large lobster roll and the huge haddock sandwich ("burger" as they call it). Delicious and filling. Sat out on the pier. Then checked out the reversing falls which this time were going in the opposite direction. Would be great fun to hop in there and pop out on the other side of the bridge!

Then the goats!  Goats, goats, goats!!!  We just had to stop at Sunset Acres again to see the goats, and goats there were!  Hundreds of goats that came running as soon as they heard one of the babies getting some attention.  This was awesome, getting goat licks and buying some more cheese. I even got a few licks from one of the goat bucks before I was warned not to scratch them or we would be smelling goat for a very long time. Of course, all the way after that Rich was saying "I think I smell goat in here!" (That might have been the little goat baby we put in the back of the car ....)

Supper was Rosalie's pizza, of course, and huge beers (Shipyard export ale) unfortunately served in Coors Light glasses. Dessert was ice cream (2 oranges) and sorbet (blueberry basil) from MDI Ice Cream. In between, we bought a t shirt at Cadillac Mtn Sports, and an Adirondack chair charm (to commemorate our time at Blagden Preserve and to mourn the passing of the real Jordan Pond House), real maple syrup for breakfast, and a "goodluck mini moose" at the Acadia shop.

Remember to check for benchmarks in: Penobscot, Searsport, Stockton Springs, anywhere else along the way, esp. Route 15, boulder fields, blueberry fields, Passagassawakeag River bridge near Belfast.
