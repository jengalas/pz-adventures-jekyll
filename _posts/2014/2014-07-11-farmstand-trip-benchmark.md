On our way back home along a currently detoured route from our favorite farm stand on Route 438, I noticed that the small bridge along the outlet of Lake Sheridan had been rebuilt. We stopped to search for a diskâ€”not expecting anything, we were surprised to find one set into the new concrete. It is a standard newer-style PennDOT disk, but it has no stamped designation. Rich thinks that PennDOT may be adding disks to new bridges just in case they're needed in the future, and not necessarily surveying them until a later date. This makes sense to me. We've found several unstamped disks in newly-replaced bridges, and I've found a few older marks that were unstamped when I first found them, but were later stamped. Perhaps next year this mark will be stamped and we'll have an update to this page!
