Visit to D&H museum in Honesdale, sat in Eclipse gravity car, saw Stourbridge Lion models, bought replacement maps and DVD of Gravity program. Walked up and down the main street, looked for survey mark on bridge (which is gone since the bridge was recently replaced around 2008-9). Bought good fruit and veggies from farmer's market, then took a look for USGS marker (covered in huge PI!) before stopping at Tick Tock's for a beer and burgers.

Day spent in Honesdale: main point was to get new copies of the gravity RR and D&H canal maps from the museum since we had lost ours in the move, but we ended up spending nearly two hours in the museum. Had to feed the meter twice. Then we walked down Main Street to check out the bridge and see if by some chance I (LY????) was still in place.  We had our doubts, especially because we could see from Google Street View that the bridge was replaced in 2009. There's always the possibility that the original abutments remained in place, though.  But in this case it wasn't to be. 

More about the museum: Lamson cash "railway" (appropriate for this museum!) from Katz's Dept. Store, Eclipse car (that was mentioned in the presentation on Tuesday), finally got a  DVD copy of the Gravity show, working live steam model of the Stourbridge Lion, man who was eager to explain it all to us, research on schools in the gift shop. Remember to add information about Box School (and find out more!) to TT 8 J.
