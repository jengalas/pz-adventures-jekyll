After Dad left (kinda promptly because rain was expected) we hiked the eastern shore of Jordan Pond, then had tea and popovers. Popovers were OK but not as hot and slightly deflated, they didn't have blueberry black tea and claimed they never had, very good crab and goat cheese dip, and popover chips, a new gimmick probably to use up leftover popovers (I guess the pigs don't get them anymore) but they were too hard.  The sun was out while we ate, but afterward we hiked the Seaside Path and it started to rain as we were going back to the Pond House.

Ask R what we did for supper - maybe Fiddlers Green and maybe our drive through the park? Have R check credit card statements. I don't have anything from this date. If it was Fiddlers we had the lobster enchilada, "little pig" (sampling of our roast pork, chile romesco and chipotle citrus bbq. sauces), panzerotti/boar, Heidi cake, blueberry pie, double espresso. Beers were Wanderlust Foundation and Green Warden.
