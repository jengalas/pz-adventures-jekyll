"Salt Spring" was my first official non-hybrid letterbox. And of course, since it's done almost nothing else but rain this October, this one was found in the rain. 

The morning began with a trip to Woodbourne Forest, where I ran into Rich, located the Woodbourne Forest Cache, got wet, caught my hand on a thorn and bled all over the place, and just generally had an awesome time. 

After that cache I went alone to the Liberty Park Cache, which I found without incident, and from there to Salt Springs. The letterbox wasn't too tough to find, though I had to retrace my steps on two of the legs to get to the right place. The box was somewhat visible when I arrived at the area, but it was a good distance off the trail. In order to look through the logbook and to stamp it myself, I had to set up my little umbrella on the hillside and hold the book underneath it. (By this time the rain was a mere drizzle, but there was still plenty dripping from the trees.) The hider had included stamped, addressed postcards that you could send her to comment on the letterbox. I only wish she'd included an e-mail address, too.

After locating the letterbox, I checked on my own nearby [Penny Rock Cache](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC26A2_penny-rock-cache?ID=9890), which someone had moved to a new spot. Good thing I located it! (I moved it back.)

Note: As of 18 January 2004, this letterbox listing seems to have disappeared from **letterboxing.org**. Does anyone know if it's still in place?

> Salt Spring State Park is located in Franklin Forks, Pa. It offers visitors a gorge with three waterfalls surrounded by a virgin hemlock forest, with walking/hiking trails winding through its 405-acre preserve. Near the base of the gorge is the salt spring, from which the park gets its name.
>
> From Montrose, Pa., go north on Route 29 for six miles. Turn left at Franklin Forks (near Snake Creek Marine) and travel 1 mile west.
>
> After parking, walk over the wooden bridge near the flagpole and acquaint yourself with the map of the park.
>
> 1. Facing the stone marker, set your sights at 110 degrees. What you want you can't see beyond the trees. Walk 73 paces, and you should be able to taste success.
> 2.  From this significant site, walk 77 paces at 100 degrees.
> 3.  You now have a choice of paths; take the trail at 130 degrees for 118 paces. WARNING, the path soon drops off  for just a few feet. Walk carefully.
> 4.  Look for an immovable landmark at 180 degrees, about 90 paces away. 
> 5.  Standing on the south side of said landmark, set a course for 80 degrees and take 84 steps. In the summer there will be stinging nettles, so wear long pants or walk carefully to keep plants from brushing bare legs.
> 6.  Set a course for 150 degrees, and walk 48 paces toward two trees that appear to form a V.
> 7.  Set your sights at 240 degrees and start "dipping" into the leaves.
>
> After you've found the letterbox, please remember to hide it where you found it. Return to the trail and head off at 80 degrees, where you will intersect with a trail that will lead you down hill to the base of the park.
>
> Be sure to check out the water falls (which can be easily climbed) and put a penny in penny rock  (on the Fall Brook Trail).

The last activity of the day was a search for the Lost Falls Cache. This one didn't turn out so well! I may come back and try again, but honestly, it was such a miserable place that I'm not in a hurry to return there.
