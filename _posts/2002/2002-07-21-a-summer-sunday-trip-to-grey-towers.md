    images:
    - filename: path
      alt: A lovely tree-lined path leads up to the door of the mansion. If you tour the house, you will enter through this door, but you may not notice the path unless you cross the road (walking away from the mansion), and go down the steps.    
    - filename: flowers
      alt: I noticed this beautiful morning glory on the porch as soon as I arrived. I'm glad I took the photo then, because when we returned later on, the blossom had wilted.
    - filename: pool
      alt: This pool area used to be open (you couldn't use the pool, but you could go sit beside it). I remember eating my lunch there once. Now it's all overgrown, and you can't go inside. I'm guessing they have big plans for this spot, but just haven't worked on it yet.     
    - filename: bb1 
      alt: If you visit, you'll learn about Cornelia's reflecting pool, which was built so that it appears longer than it is when viewed from this end (it's 18 inches wide at the near end and only 10 inches wide at the far end).
    - filename: bb2
      alt: At the far end of the reflecting pool is the Bait Box, which was built as a playhouse for Gifford Pinchot's son and is now used as a meeting room.    
    - filename: mansion
      alt: The mansion itself, in as people-free a photo as I could possibly manage on that day.
    - filename: bushes
      alt: A view of part of the mansion (and some peopleâ€”it's tough to avoid people on a Summer weekend!) from down in the yard. Those are some massive bushes!          
    - filename: lilypads
      alt: Lilypads in the fish pond. I loved their bright colors.
    - filename: shed
      alt: A creepy little building I found strangely attractive. I passed by it on the way to the falls.    
    - filename: falls
      alt: The falls, which are much higher and more impressive than they appear here. They are located just a short walk through the woods from the mansion.
