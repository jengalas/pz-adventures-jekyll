Triangulation station HEM ET was an easy find, but it still required a steep hike that was sufficient to warm us up on this chilly autumn day. After a small miscalculation that landed us on the wrong woods road and led to the grounds of a hunting club, we retraced our steps and found a much better access point to North Mountain. We encountered several hunters while hiking the woods road, but after turning onto the trail along the ridge to approach the station, we were alone. The marks were all easy to locate, well exposed and mostly in accordance with the 1968 description. On our way back to Rich's vehicle we stopped at a high point on the woods road where we could see across the valley. We spotted several towers, including one that may have been the Harvey Fire Tower (the azimuth mark), though we couldn't be sure at the time.
