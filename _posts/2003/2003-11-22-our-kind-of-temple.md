An easy geocache hunt at Moon Lake County Park (a great place for mountain biking!) was followed by a trek through a cemetery and open woods to triangulation station TEMPLE atop the Shickshinny Mountain ridge. This late-November day was even nice enough for a nap on the mountaintop overlooking Nanticoke.
