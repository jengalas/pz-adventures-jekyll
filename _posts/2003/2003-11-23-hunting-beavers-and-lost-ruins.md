It's always fun when we can begin the day with a geocache hunt (particularly when it turns out to be an unexpected First Find!), and then follow it up with some benchmark hunts. 

Our first benchmark of the day, R 235, proved to be an exciting find! I love coming across manmade structures in the woods. We began our search too far north at a private road leading to some hunting cabins. We soon determined it was unlikely that a house had ever stood at this location, and we walked south on PA Route 402 for just over 100 yards until on our right we noticed a level area covered in young pine growth. Entering the woods at this point, we saw the steps immediately, and off to their right was a decrepit stone foundation filled—and surrounded—with old glass bottles, rusted cans, and other junk such as a child's rusted bed mattress. The mark was found on the steps exactly as described.

Triangulation stations can be even more fun than regular vertical benchmarks, and the one called BEAVER, also along Route 402, intrigued us. The recovery of the station mark and reference marks 1 and 2 was straightforward. They are located on an easily accessible knoll on State Forest land less than 200 feet west of Route 402. All three marks are in good condition.

Finding the azimuth mark proved difficult. We drove a bit more than a quarter mile north on Route 402, then began to search along the western side of the highway. More than thirty minutes went by before Rich finally found something interesting enough to investigate. He'd come across a corner of concrete just poking out of the ground. We cleared the area as well as we could and discovered that this was in fact the concrete monument holding the azimuth mark, but it was lying in the ground tipped on its side as if it had been struck by heavy equipment. The disk itself is in good enough condition that we could positively identify it, but because of the condition of the setting the mark's value has likely been compromised.
