What a day!  We got up early and left Scranton even earlier than we had planned, wondering if we might still have a shot at a first find on the new Waterboy cache. We took our time walking and talking on the trail, and it wasn’t till we were within a few hundred feet of the first part that we sensed we might not be alone. We heard some rustling in the woods and soon saw a human figure wandering slightly off-trail. 

We initiated a quick search and found the first stage easily, and waited a few seconds for our “companion” to spot us. I felt sure that if any other geocacher were here in the woods this early in the morning, it would have to be Tyson. As he came nearer I could see that it was indeed the chicken-man himself.  We talked for a while, but we were all excited to move on and find the final cache.

After a nice long chat and plenty of amusing photo opportunities, Tyson decided he’d head back to his truck, and Rich and I climbed back up on the Knife’s Edge (slowly this time!) to lounge the rest of the morning away. For one of the first times this summer, we sat in full sunshine, and we took in the beautiful view while being cooled by the slightest breeze. We snacked on jellies and nougats and a lemon Tastykake pie and talked about the Grand Canyon. 

While we rested on the ledge Jinx and Magic appeared, en route to the cache, and we had a pleasant little conversation. We finally tore ourselves away from the view—before we turned to stone!—and walked at a relaxed pace back to the parking area, taking time along the way to explore some other ledges just off the trail.

After our exhilarating hike and cache find, we decided to search for a few benchmarks in the area. The first was P 191, a mark along Bake Oven Road that I searched for unsuccessfully almost a year ago. With much more experience and a willing and determined partner at my side, I figured we'd find it easily today, but we had no such luck.  Rich and I carefully measured out the given distances, and the measurements placed me right on top of a particular rock that I soon found out had already been claimed by thousands of red ants. But there was no mark to be found. It's possible the disk is located beneath the boulder (which we realize now we should have moved) or the pile of soil and sand adjacent to it. 

We then moved along to N 191, another mark I was unable to find last year. This time, the description (along with plenty of careful searching and a little luck) was enough to allow us to locate the mark! Except for the witness post and the barn lot fence, all landmarks in the description are still in place. The "Y road" mentioned in the description refers to the intersection of Germans Road and Bake Oven Road, which lies just to the southwest of the mark. The concrete monument has been disturbed, but aside from a few scratches the disk itself is in good condition and the stamping is clearly legible.

Our third mark for today, J 192, was one neither of us had searched for before. Expecting a railroad crossing based on the description, we were surprised when we arrived to find that the area is now heavily wooded and no rails exist. We were able to make out the railbeds but both the north and south tracks are no longer in place. After estimating the distances from the railbeds and Stone Mountain Road and checking several large boulders in the area, we zeroed in on the correct boulder and scraped the surface clean of moss and ants to reveal the disk. 

Today's final activity was a relaxing walk along the Lehigh Canal in search of one more geocache. The weather was much more cooperative today than it was last June when I was at the canal, when the temperature was about 102° and the air was thick with humidity. Today we walked under sunny skies in dry air with a gentle breeze. And it’s such a picturesque area! We both found the cache quite easily.  We sat on the nearby bench and talked until I almost dozed off.
