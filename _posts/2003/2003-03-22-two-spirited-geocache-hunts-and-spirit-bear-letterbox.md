Thanks to RenegadeJane, I discovered that there was a letterbox very close to her The Love Shack and Beyond geocache. I probably wouldn’t have remembered to check the letterboxing site otherwise. Spirit Bear was an easy find for me while Aaron, who was feeling sick at the time, rested on the porch of the “Love Shack”. After a rough winter it was especially nice to have such a warm, springlike day for our hike.
