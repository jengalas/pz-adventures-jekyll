We couldn't get enough of this peaceful preserve tucked away in the rural area just west of Bethany Beach. On our second visit, we rode past Sassafras Landing and Strawberry Landing all the way to Mulberry Landing on the bay. From here, you can see the Fenwick Island Lighthouse, from which this letterbox takes its name, and northern Ocean City. 

The [Fenwick Island Lighthouse letterbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20030712160906/http://letterboxing.org:80/BoxView.asp?boxnum=2021&boxname=Fenwick_Island_Lighthouse) was a quick find but nevertheless enjoyable. It was a beautiful sunny day, tooâ€”a rarity on this vacation. I wished we'd brought a picnic lunch, because there are tables right by the water! We sat at one of them while I stamped in, and we relaxed for a while and watched fishermen fishing and crabber-women crabbing.

After our time at the preserve, we also spent some time looking for benchmarks. And this evening, we did a webcam geocache with the help of Rich.
