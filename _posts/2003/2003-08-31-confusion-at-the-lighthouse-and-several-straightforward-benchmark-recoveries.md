I had quite an interesting time today trying to sort out the details for a few survey marks near the Fenwick Island lighthouse. There is apparently some confusion between FENWICK IS MARK 1 and 1 USCG. Like FENWICK IS MARK 1, 1 USCG is also a Coast Guard disk stamped “No. 1”, set in a post projecting five inches. The post I found at the site projects much more than five inches, but less than two feet. 

There are also problems with this mark's description. The mark cannot be on the left side of the east-west road if it is also north of this road. If the fence mentioned in this description surrounded the lighthouse like the present fence does, the mark could not be at the southwest fence corner if it is reached before the lighthouse when traveling west. The situation might have been clearer if the monumented year had been stamped on the disk. Very interesting!

The rest of the marks I searched for were relatively straightforward, even though I didn't find all of them for various reasons. One particularly neat mark is a reference mark disk set atop the Transpeninsular Line monument stone just south of the Fenwick Island Lighthouse. The 252 year old monument is part of a line that was surveyed to settle a boundary dispute between the Penns and the Calverts, and which established the middle point of the peninsula.
