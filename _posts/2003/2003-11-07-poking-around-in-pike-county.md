After two successful geocache hunts this morning (Welcome! and Tarkill Interpretive Trail), Rich and I decided to try searching for a few benchmarks in the Milford area. Triangulation station CS PEIRCE looked intriguing as it was supposed to be on the grounds of a Park Service historical house that neither of us had noticed before. We found the station mark without difficulty along the wooded northeast edge of the front lawn. Its location is indicated by an angled pipe stuck in the ground adjacent to the mark. As we were clearing the mark of debris, an NPS employee approached us to find out what we were doing. Upon learning that we were recovering the mark and not geocaching, he left us to continue our work.

Reference mark 1 was found easily on the headwall of the culvert along the road directly in front of the house. Like the station mark, it is also in good condition, and it is easily visible from a distance. Though we searched extensively, we were unable to locate the second reference mark. There was plenty of confusion over which landing might have been the one referred to, so we searched all corners of all the landings on the north and east sides of the house, and took measurements from the telephone pole as well. We found no chiseled cross. Interestingly, the corner of the landing we thought most likely to have held the mark has been damaged; it's probable that the mark was on this corner and therefore no longer exists.

According to the datasheet the azimuth mark was located less than 1000 feet away, along Routes 6 & 209. We drove to the site after finishing our work at the Peirce house. Upon beginning our search near the powerpole, we were immediately approached by a young busybody who demanded to know what we were doing. She left and, for some unknown reason, came back to demand the same information of us a few minutes later. We mostly ignored her and continued our search, but it was certainly a curious reaction to people working in a highway right-of-way, not on private property. Unfortunately, we were unable to find any sign of the mark, even though our measurements from reference objects matched the description. It is likely that the mark still exists but is covered by a fresh layer of asphalt.

It is fitting that a triangulation station was placed on the grounds of this estate, as Peirce was a prominent geodesist with the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey, serving from from 1859 to 1891. He was additionally a mathematician, scientist, philosopher (founder of pragmatism) and, somewhat by necessity, a writer. In 1887 he retired, eventually becoming ill and destitute, to this Milford estate (“Arisbe”) where he died in 1914. More information on the house and Peirce himself is available at the historic site near the station mark, and at the following websites: [Peirce Edition Project](https://peirce.iupui.edu/) and [Spanning the Gap](http://www.npshistory.com/publications/dewa/spanning-the-gap/v22-3.pdf).

After this exciting recovery, Rich and I failed to find a survey disk on a bridge along Route 402. But we did make a successful recovery of NGS bench mark disk T 235 after just a short hike along Lake Laura Road.
