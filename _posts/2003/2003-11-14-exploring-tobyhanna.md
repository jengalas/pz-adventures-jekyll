Today's adventures were relatively quick, because it was cold and horribly windy! We were intrigued by a "moving geocache" that showed up in nearby Tobyhanna State Park. And we couldn't pass up the opportunity for a quick benchmark search along the way. But it was much too cold to hang around outside for long ... and we will have to wait for another day to place the moving geocache in its new location!
