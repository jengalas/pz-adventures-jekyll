Today's explorations were very successful.  We succeeded in finding and recovering the complete set of marks for two triangulation stations (electronic traverse, as noted by USGS).  

We had been interested in CLIFF ET for some time but were unlucky two weeks ago when no one was available to give us permission to cross private property.  

Based on the coordinates, I presume that these are two of the most westernmost "LY" marks; the PID prefix changes to "LZ" at W076Â°.
