Today we decided to tackle THROOP once more, to see if we could find the remaining reference mark. This time we were more optimistic as I'd found some measurements on the official datasheets that I expected would help us locate RM 1. We measured out the distances and angles and found the mark almost immediately, though it was buried under several inches of soil thanks to the woodchucks who have made their home adjacent to the post. All three disks are in excellent condition with all stamping legible, and have been cleared of mud and moss. The 1974 description errs in stating that RM 1 is 17 feet west of the witness post; the actual direction is nearer southeast.
