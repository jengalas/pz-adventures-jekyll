Today Rich suggested a walk at Lackawanna State Park.  We live so close now, but for some reason we have only been here a few times since last summer.  I had no idea we'd hit the wildflower jackpot today!  The woods were alive, both with the bright colors of many wildflowers and with the singing of birds and drumming of woodpeckers high in the trees.  The pileated woodpecker eluded us again, but we know he's here somewhere!  

Our route followed the Abington Trail with a short detour on a trail we had never seen before (Joe's Trail, or something similar), looping around and joining the Turkey Hill Trail near the stone walls and fallen tree where I usually sit for squirrel hunting.  We hiked the complete Turkey Hill Trail before returning to the visitors center, where we had parked.  The easternmost section of the Turkey Hill Trail is typically a slog through deep mud and standing water.  Today, thanks to our dry spring, it was an easy, dry walk.
