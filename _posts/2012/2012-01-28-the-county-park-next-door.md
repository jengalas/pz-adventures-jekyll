Rich and I took a short walk on this warm January day to admire the hard work and artistry of our neighbor, Doug.  Over the past five years, he has transformed this once brush- and weed-filled plot into a work of landscape art.  And the work continues!  I doubt he'll ever be "done," but he really enjoys the work, and as his neighbors we really appreciate and enjoy the results.
