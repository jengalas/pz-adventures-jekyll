Today John and Chris completed all 40+ miles of the Five Boro Bike Tour in New York City.   It was a terribly hot and humid day and riders were dropping like flies all over the place, but John and Chris persevered.  Lance got stuck at the back of the pack and John was free to fly all the way to the finish ... sadly, he was passed by a girl in the last few seconds of the final sprint!

Of course, Rich and Zhanna just had to complete a 5 Boro Bike Tour of their own: Olyphant, Peckville, Jessup, Winton, and Archbald!
