This is the adorable crochet moose I made for Rich while he was in the hospital.  That was back in May, but we didn't get around to taking any photos until this week ... and of course we missed some great opportunities for outdoor photos while the weather was still nice.

The pattern is available on Etsy: [Moose Wayne](http://www.etsy.com/listing/62468788/moose-pattern-pdf)

It was my first attempt at crochet, and I'm thrilled at how he came out.  Rich was too!  The moose cheered him up when he was in pain and was also a big hit with the nurses and physical therapists.
