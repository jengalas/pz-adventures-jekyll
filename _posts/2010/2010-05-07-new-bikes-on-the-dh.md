Rich and Zhanna have new bikes! Today we took them out for a spin on the D&H rail-trail.  We rode about 10 miles north from the Forest City trailhead ... turning around just south of a benchmark that we didn't know about until we got home. We tried a new local Mexican place, Chicano's, to refuel afterward. It was awesome!
