How is it that neither one of us has been on Hubbard Mountain before today?!  I still don't know.  It's so close to home and obviously has plenty of trails for hiking and biking.  We began talking about it last weekend, and by this weekend I was ready to explore.  I loved the drive up "Rustic Lane"—an aptly named old road used, I assume, for access by the utility companies—that basically goes straight up the mountain.  I was even somewhat tempted to drive the powerlines toward the first cache, but we really needed the hike, and it was a beautiful (if windy) day.
