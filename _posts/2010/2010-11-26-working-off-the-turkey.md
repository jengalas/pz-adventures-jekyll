Two turkey dinners yesterday provided more than enough calories to fuel rigorous outdoor activities today.  Unfortunately, the windy weather didn't entice us to go for a ride or a long hike, but we did decide to revisit the Archbald Regional Park again, just like last week, and explore the network of walking paths winding through a small patch of forest.

Although the trails are paved—we prefer gravel—they would nevertheless be a lot of fun for a leisurely spin through the woods on our bikes, especially when combined with all the other riding opportunities in the adjoining Archbald Pothole State Park.

On our way home, we stopped to pick up a pizza at La Padrinos on Kennedy Drive in Archbald.  With its thin crust and sweet sauce it was more than edible, if not great.  We would buy it again.  Now we have to work off the calories from the pizza!
