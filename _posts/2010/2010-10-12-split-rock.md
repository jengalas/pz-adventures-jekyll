This is our first attempt at growing a "split rock" (_Pleiospilos nelii_).  I've heard they are notoriously difficult and need a lot of sun, which is certainly not something we have an abundance of in northeastern Pennsylvania.  But he was so cute and only $2.50 this morning at Lowe's.  We couldn't resist.

To our surprise, after a few hours in the sun, the flower we had thought was pretty much dead opened up and filled our afternoon with a burst of tangerine color!
