Yesterday was a frigid, blustery day with snow flurries and arctic winds.  This morning, even though it was cold, the air was calm and the sun was out.  Rich and I needed to get out of the house, so we decided to take a little walk around town and experiment with the new camera I gave him for his birthday.

Our walk took us down to the River Trail at Decker's Bridge, then west to Mellow Park, where we walked the newly resurfaced trail alongside the river.  A gas station along the trail was recently remodeled and now features a Nathan's hot dog stand and an ice cream stand. We crossed the bridge over the river and hiked back along the railroad tracks and back home via Church Street.  Even on these short hikes around town, we find plenty to comment on and usually discover something new.
