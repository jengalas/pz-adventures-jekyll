We spent this calm, warm, sunny, blue-sky morning hunting squirrels at Lackawanna State Park.  They weren't too active today, but I finally did see one hopping among the treetops.  I followed him for a while, thinking I would eventually get a shot, but I never did.  Rich saw two squirrels from his favorite spot in the middle of the wooded area surrounded by the Turkey Hill Trail, but they eluded him too.  It was fun anyway!  We did see plenty of wildlife: a murder (or several!) of crows, a few chipmunks, and a crazed woodpecker; and Rich heard a turkey calling in the distance.
