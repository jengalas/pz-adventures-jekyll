This morning we heard that bones had been found by ATV riders off Marshwood Road, in an area where we sometimes go mountain biking.  These stories typically cause all kinds of alarm until it's discovered that the bones in question are from a deer carcass or something else non-human.  (Although no aliens have yet been found, to my knowledge.)

After a Mexican lunch—that would have been Japanese instead, were the Japanese place open on Mondays—with John, Rich and I took the long way home past the "bones."  We stopped for a quick photo of the commotion, including the CSI Winnebago, and were quickly descended upon by local news reporters anxious to fill some air time with profound quotes from the locals.  We declined the interview, even though they'd already buttered us up with the typical leading questions and were practically begging us to say something on camera.  

We did learn from them that the bones had just been confirmed to be human.  I'm sure they wanted their usual "This is such a quiet place, I can't believe any foul play would go on around here" sound bite.  (It would be interesting if someone just once would say, "Oh, this kind of thing happens all the time up here!  It's about time someone found the evidence!")
