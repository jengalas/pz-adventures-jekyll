Today's outing was a nice, easy ride from Forest City to just past Herrick Center and back, all on the D&H.  What a radical change we had today from our recent sunny, hot weather! It was a breezy day that was pretty pleasant when we rode into patches of sunshine, but fully chilling when we were beneath the heavy clouds that dominated the skies today.  Colored leaves swirled around us and were beginning to cover the trail in spots.

The trail surface changes past Herrick Center to a deeper, heavier gravel, but it's still much more rideable than we'd expected.  Next time, I think we will try to ride even farther north.  I'm not sure at which point we'll run into original ballast, but I'm certain it's out there.

The sky was black by the time we returned to the parking lot, and it began to sprinkle just as Rich loaded our bikes back onto the car.   We should have known that John would ride a few more miles in the rain before heading back home!
