We've had a lot of fun so far this season, but no squirrels.  On the first day of the season, a cold, blustery Saturday, we hunted the Turkey Hill section of the park.  We saw half a dozen other hunters in the woods, but very few squirrels.  Rich had a shot, but somehow the little bugger got away.  I saw only two squirrelsâ€”one that just popped its head over a stone wall and disappeared, never to be seen again, and another that mockingly tiptoed along the wall just as I realized I'd had too much coffee and, uh, squatted behind a large tree to relieve myself.  After a few hours we hurried home, anxious to warm up with some tea and soup.

Wednesday we hiked the Orchard Trail, a nice singletrack trail that weaves narrowly between the highway and the lake.  It would be great for mountain biking during a dry period; however, even after our extremely dry summer, the trail was still saturated from the previous day's rain.  Rich saw one squirrel that was so quick I didn't even catch a glimpse before he was gone down the trail.  We also saw one doe crossing the trail and four herons near the lake.

Today, at long last, I got one! Time for squirrel potpie.
