Today’s puzzle cache turned out to be more interesting than it looked at first glance. While a bit of research made it clear to us the common thread among the people listed in the cache description, and what bit of data we needed to find about each person, there were some ambiguities that led to a large number of possibilities. Enter a quick Python script I wrote to help us try the different outcomes and keep track of what worked and what didn’t! It didn’t take long before we had the “green light” from the Certitude geo-checker.
