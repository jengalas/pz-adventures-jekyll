Determined to explore the rest of the Lehigh Gorge Trail while our enthusiasm was at its peak, Rich and I returned today to the scene of [last week's deluge](/2007/08/17/riding-in-the-storm-at-lehigh-gorge).  This time, though, we drove to the southern terminus of the trail (at Glen Onoko, which is also the starting point for the annual Death Hike) and planned to ride north to Penn Haven Junction, where we had turned around last time, or perhaps even further to Rockport.
