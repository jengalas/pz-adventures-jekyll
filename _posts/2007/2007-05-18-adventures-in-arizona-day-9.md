**"Uh, Willcox isn't a great place to eat.  But ... Salsa Fiesta is the best place to eat in Willcox!"**

_In which the mooses discover their own mountainous desert hideaway, wander among politically-incorrectly-named rock formations, survive a thunder- and hailstorm brought on by Zhanna's Vortex Hat, find a surprise benchmark at an historic ranch house, and stuff themselves silly at Salsa Fiesta._

<!-- Got up early, breakfast at Country Folks (French toast; pancakes and burned bacon (R).) Went right to Chiricahua.  Visitor's Center, got maps, etc.  Massai Point - photos and interpretive trail with exhibit hut.  Thunder.  Drove to Echo Canyon Trailhead, where we started out on the Ed Riggs Trail.  Thunder and lightning in parking lot, began to rain as we headed down trail. Pouring and hailing before long. Didn't let up till nearly done with the Hailstone Trail. Stopped for snacks and continued on to Echo Canyon Trail, which was incredibly beautiful.  Climbed out of canyon through forests and rocky areas (Wall Street) taking photos along the way. Saw lots of lizards and awesome colorful rock formations.  Encountered trail workers.  Went back to the visitor's center to ask about dinner recommendations. Happened to mention that we recover BMs (wondered aloud if there was one at Sugarloaf) and the volunteer mentioned that there was one at Faraway Ranch, so we went to check that out.  Very impressive park all around.  Salsa Fiesta in Willcox for supper (marinated shrimp cocktail, beef taco & bean tostada, cherry chimi; green chili con carne burrito (R).) Went to bed early.  -->
