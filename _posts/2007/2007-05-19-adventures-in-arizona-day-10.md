**"I hope you're not counting on taking a luxurious shower!"**

_In which the mooses visit a church without being struck by lightning, search for a tri-station in a restricted area at the National Observatory without getting caught, travel the Ajo Mountain Drive without busting the oil pan or getting locked in, and consume Pizza Hut pizza and Budweiser without admitting it to anyone (well, until now)._

<!-- Got up at 5:00 officially, 6:00 for real.  Breakfast at Country Folks (breakfast sandwich; pancakes and burned bacon (by request) for R).  Drove to mission looking for goodies - no goodies for sale, building under construction, 1st communion going on later in the day. Kitt Peak - bought BM pins, asked about the mark and were told it was off-limits.  We'll see about that!  Took tour of solar telescope.  Tour leader in training knew about BMs - had gone out with a group of people to find some in the area. He also knew about the Kitt Peak mark and had found it before they told him not to go up there.  So we had to check it out ourselves.  He pointed out that it was near the 4-meter telescope under the radio tower.  We climbed onto the huge outcrop and found the mark and 2 of the RMs easily (the other, RM2, is missing).  Knew we could be seen the entire time so we were very cautious and tried to work quickly.  Went into telescope afterward - couldn't see mark but had an excellent view overall.  Did 2 other marks afterward - culvert and AZDOT mark on outcrop near base of mountain.  Then drove to Ajo - checked into weird motel (Copper Sands) - but no scarier than other places in town. Went for snack at Senor Sanchez.  Then to park, visitor's center  closed, did the Ajo Mountain Drive all the while worried about the condition of the roads and whether the gate would be closed when we got back (it wasn't).  A few miles in, stopped to do LOW HILL. Saw 2 owls and some quail and rabbits, natural arches and caves.  Pulled over at Ajo Mtn(?) Wayside to look at stars. Coyote. Pizza Hut for snack before bed.-->
