Another neighborhood benchmark! I love the ones we can walk (or ride) to.  Note that although this is on the same bridge as the old PDH bench mark (shown on the topo map as `BM 1219`), it is not the same mark. The bridge was apparently rehabilitated or replaced, and that mark is gone. This is a newer PennDOT disk. It is in good condition, but the stamping isn't completely legible. My best guess is that the final digit is a 3.
