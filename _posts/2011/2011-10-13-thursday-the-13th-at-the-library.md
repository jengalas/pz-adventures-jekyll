Most people who know me are aware I don't do holiday decorating.  It just never excited me, not to mention the fact that I have enough stuff lying around the house that I actually _use_; I really don't need more stuff lying around for little to no purpose.  But like a person who doesn't want kids of their own but loves babysitting or teaching, there's no reason I can't turn on a bit of the "spirit" (bad Halloween pun, sorry) and get my decorating kicks at work.

Last week I happened to wander downstairs to find Elaine and Desi deep in decorating bliss as they arranged Halloween items in the glass display case near the library entrance.  Somehow I got drawn into this and actually had fun arranging the books and fake leaves and orange pod-things.  The haunted house was especially awesome, but it needed some "life" (death?) in the form of a ghost or skeleton.  

So tonight I brought in two Lego skeletons to add to the display.  We have one chilling out on the second floor balcony, and one opening the front door to find out what all the commotion is about.  ("Oh, just another insane library patron ranting and raving, nothing new to see here.")  I was also planning to bring a Lego ghost (glow in the dark, awesome!) but my ghosts are currently MIA.

Thanks to Elaine, Desi and Kathy for a spectacularly spooky display and a fun night of lunacy at the library!
