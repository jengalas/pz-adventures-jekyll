It has been a LONG, cold winter.  Biking has been out of the question since New Year's Day, and walks around town have been our only semi-adventures over the past six weeks (with all the ice on the sidewalks, it's actually more "adventurous" than one would expect).  

We have turned our attention to jigsaw puzzles.  We finally completed the "Acadia" puzzle John bought for us at Jordan Pond House and then carried all the way back on his bike.  Easier than some of our other puzzles, it was still a challenge at times, and it was interesting and fun to piece together all the little scenes while reminiscing about our favorite vacation spot.  Thanks again, John!!!
