For months now, Rich and I have wanted John to experience the Switchback Trail, and we were eager to ride it again ourselves.  We were all free on this warm, sunny Sunday, and it was easy to convince John that it was time to try something a little different from the Lehigh Gorge trail. We began in Jim Thorpe and followed the trail up to the junction just beyond Mauch Chunk Lake Park, and then took the hard right to ride all the way up to the summit of Mt. Pisgah. The day was all-around awesome, and John appreciated the carry ledge as much as we thought he would!
