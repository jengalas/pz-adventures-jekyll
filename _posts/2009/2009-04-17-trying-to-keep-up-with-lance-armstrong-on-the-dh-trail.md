Finally, a gorgeous, warm Friday descends upon NEPA!  Rich and I met up with John "Camping Guy" Guzzi at the D&H trailhead in Forest City for a leisurely late morning/early afternoon ride.  Fighting a headwind, mud, and nasty potholes from horses' hooves, we rode north to Herrick Center, stopping briefly along the way at the bridge over the Lackawanna River (where we found [LY1043](https://thesurveystation.com/surveymarks/ly1043/) two years ago) and at Stillwater Dam.  We got quite a workout!  

A very brief search for [LY1044](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=ly1044) was quickly deemed futile, and the trail condition was deteriorating badly by this point anyway.  We turned around, knowing we'd make nearly 16 miles for the day, and flew back to our starting point, potholes, mud, and wind (yes, a headwind again, somehow) be damned.  Lance, eat my dust!
