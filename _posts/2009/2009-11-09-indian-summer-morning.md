For various reasons, Rich and I haven’t touched our bikes since we last rode at the Lehigh Gorge in September (riding the bike trainer in the basement doesn’t really count). But today was a gorgeous, sunny, dry day with temperatures in the 70s (the type of weather we should have had in June!) and we just had to get out for a ride. We wore our Team Moose jerseys for the first time!

After our usual journey of about 10.5 miles that takes us through Olyphant and along the River Trail to Archbald and then back home, we finally modeled our Team Moose jerseys for a photo, which we sent to “Mr. Moose” at [Moose Garden](https://www.moosegarden.com/) in Sweden.
