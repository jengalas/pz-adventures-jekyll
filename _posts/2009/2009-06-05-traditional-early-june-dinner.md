We generally choose an evening in early June to celebrate my father's birthday with a unique (sometimes exotic!) meal. We've visited the French Manor a few times, and for the past few years have really enjoyed the Settlers Inn in Hawley.

It was raining this evening, but there is something about the late spring rain that makes a cozy setting like Settlers Inn seem even cozier. (And this is coming from someone who is generally not a fan of rain!)

In the mood for some adventure and variety, we chose two beer samplers to share for our beverages. One sampler included Bellâ€™s Oberon, Reissdorf Koelsch, Brooklyn Brown, and Triple Karmeliet, while the other featured Steelhead Extra Pale Ale, Schneider Weisse, Southern Tier IPA, and Delerium Tremens. I tried hard not to fill up on bread like I usually do, but their "birdseed bread" offering (an oat-based bread topped with a variety of seeds) was delicious and I ate more than I should have!

Rich and my mother are fans of chicken liver, so they split the chicken liver appetizer special, while Dad and I shared a platter of brioche toasts topped with strawberries, ricotta, arugula leaf, and balsamic syrup.

For his entree, Rich ordered the seared scallops & gnocchi with lemon-lavender jam (yes, he ate and liked it!), with sugar snap peas. I chose the pork loin topped with a sauce of cranberry, rhubarb, and lavender, cheesy Lyonnaise-style potatoes, and broccolini and greens. And Mom and Dad both ordered roasted chicken stuffed with berries and Brie. Their dishes came with Swiss chard, and saffron rice with pistachios.

We were all pleasantly full with just enough room left to try a small dessert: we chose English toffee pudding, which was pleasantly buttery, not overly rich, and not too sweet. It was the perfect way to end a beautiful springtime meal!
