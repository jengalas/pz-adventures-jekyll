What an incredible mid-week outing! Not only did we ride the entire length of the Lehigh Gorge trail from Glen Onoko to White Haven, but along the way we came upon a bear cub poking around alongside the trail! We (and the other trail users) were very cautious in case mama bear was nearby, but no adult bear ever emerged, and eventually the cub moved far enough off the trail that we felt comfortable in passing by.
