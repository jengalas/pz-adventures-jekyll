I've been putting it off for a long while, but maybe it's time to start looking for the puzzle pieces in the Piecing Together the Past geocache series. I began tonight with #7, Forging Ahead.

(Funny story, this cache is one of the reasons I was hesitant to work on the series. I have a geocache at the iron furnaces, and the owner of this one seemed irritated that he/she had to place theirs elsewhere because I had already claimed their desired spot [back in 2002].)
