Our neighbor, Doug, maintains a property of 15+ beautiful acres. We're fortunate that he welcomes us to wander here at any time! The park features a wooded area with trails, a large open grassy area studded with trees, a pond, a wooden bridge, a creek, and a waterfall.

October has been very warm and dry this year, so the fall color is somewhat lacking, but honestly, I can appreciate the colors of summer for as long as they last! (Because I know what's coming soon!)
