Today's wet conditions made me a bit hesitant but I decided to go for my geocache-walk anyway. My feet took me to the Everhart Museum at Nay Aug Park (quite a walk from the University on a hot, humid day!). I poked around for a bit and eventually found the cache, #4 in the "Piecing Together the Past" series. This is not the greatest hiding spot, but somehow the cache has survived here for several months.
