Finally, Rich has been able to join me on a few of these "Pieces of the Past" geocache hunts! While out and about today running a few errands, we decided to stop at McDade Park and look for the two geocaches here from the series. We were successful with both, and we had a lot of fun exploring the mining equipment and museum. This lovely (if chilly) summer day was made complete with a stop at John's Corn for some fresh veggies on the way home!
