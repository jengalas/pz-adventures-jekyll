We were anticipating another debacle of some kind at the airport this morning, but by some miracle, everything was smooth sailing today!  We woke up at 3:00am, finished pulling together our last-minute items, and were ready to leave the house just after 4:00. Dad graciously drove us down to the airport ... and promptly went home for some sleep since he also worked driving the bus the evening before. 

<!-- He had been thinking about stopping at Zummo's but they weren't even open yet.  -->

Our 6:15 flight left on time, and had us in Philly before 7:00am. And our 8:40 flight left basically on time after being in a long queue, and arrived a bit early, around 10:45, in Phoenix. It was awesome to be there so early!  We had the back seats on this second flight.  Pro: we had the row to ourselves! No screaming kids and no one coughing on us from behind. Cons: endless lines of people going to the lav and then slamming the door as hard as they could. Still, we were able to get some sleep, and the flight was pleasant overall. We picked up our rental car from Alamo without issue, and took our "new" Toyota Camry right onto the highway headed for Tucson.  It was a typically beautiful Arizona spring day with temperatures in the mid 80s. It was windy, with gusts of dust accosting us every now and then while we drove. But nothing beats the beauty of the spring desert!

After getting ourselves settled, we headed right out for supper at Cafe Poca Cosa. Everything was fantastic, and beautifully presented. As we walked around the area, we noticed a neat art installation of cacti crafted from glass. They were beautiful and almost as colorful as our meals!

We went straight back to the room and were napping by 5:30pm!
