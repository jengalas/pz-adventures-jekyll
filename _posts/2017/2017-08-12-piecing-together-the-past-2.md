While on our walk on the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail this morning, Rich and I found "Piecing Together the Past #2." If you've been keeping track, you'll notice that this is my 12th and final geocache find in the "Pieces of the Past" series! I have all twelve puzzle pieces to fit into their frame. I'm so happy that Rich was able to join me on this hunt just like the last two. We think this cache may have moved from its intended location, and it is currently quite exposed, so we hid it as well as possible and notified the owner.
