Today's geocache finds are two more examples of why I wasn't thrilled about this series, even though the idea was excellent and I enjoyed each hunt to some degree. The cache owner (who has only one find, by the way) seems to have been given leeway that others weren't. You might recall that he/she had to move their cache farther away from the iron furnaces because I already had a cache there, and geocaches must be at least one tenth of a mile apart. 

Well, for both of the caches I found today, the cache owner (and apparently the reviewer as well) seems to have thrown the rules out the window. Their published coordinates are hundreds of feet off from the actual hiding spots to fit the tenth-of-a-mile rule. And then the actual coordinates or a description of the hiding spot is given in the hint.  Pretty sneaky, if you ask me. I still enjoyed my little lunchtime diversion, but with just a slightly sour taste in my mouth.
