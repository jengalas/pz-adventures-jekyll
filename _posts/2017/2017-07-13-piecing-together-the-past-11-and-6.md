Today's goal was another part of the Piecing Together the Past geocache series, #11 (All Aboard!) at the Radisson hotel very close to my office. This was a pretty easy find, but it's in a very busy place so be prepared to look suspicious as you poke around in the shrubbery! I also noticed some vermin control boxes in the same area ... I hope no one mistakes one of them for the cache!

On the way back, I located another geocache in the series, #6. The theme of #6 was the Catlin House, which now houses the Lackawanna Historical Society, but because of geocache proximity issues the cache had to be hidden in a slightly different (and quite creative) spot visible—but not accessible—from the University campus.
