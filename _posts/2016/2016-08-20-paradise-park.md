This morning's adventure was an easy stroll around our neighbor's property, 15 gorgeous acres that we call "the park." Our neighbor, Doug, is not interested in naming the park; he simply calls it Paradise. "Paradise Park" works for us!

Enjoy these lovely photos of the late-summer scenery that caught Rich's eye ...
