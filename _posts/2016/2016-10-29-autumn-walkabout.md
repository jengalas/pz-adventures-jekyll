<blockquote>Yet under reason burns a brighter fire, which the bones<br>
have always preferred.<br>
It is the story of endless good fortune.<br>
It says to oblivion: not me!<br><br>


It is the light at the center of every cell.<br>
It is what sent the snake coiling and flowing forward<br>  
happily all spring through the green leaves before<br> 
he came to the road.

<span style="float: right; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">â€”<em>from <strong>The Black Snake</strong> by Mary Oliver</em></span>
