<h1>The Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything</h1>
By Zhanna

<p>No, this isn’t one of <em>those</em> kinds of posts. I certainly don’t have any actual answers to major questions, but we did solve a fun geocache puzzle this evening. We had come across this listing a few days ago, but didn’t have any good ideas about what to do with it. I was in the bathtub this evening when a good idea struck (no, I did not leap out of the tub shouting “Eureka!”) and it turned out to be correct. This certainly was a fun cache for a coder!</p>

        <p>This puzzle had us scratching our heads for a couple of days. Then I had an idea, and it turned out to be right! We got the green light from the geo-checker along with the parking coordinates. The location is a little out of the way for us, but if we happen to be in the area we will try to find the cache. Thanks for a fun puzzle!</p>
