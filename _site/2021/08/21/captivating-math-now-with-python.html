<h1>Captivating Math … Now With Python!</h1>
By Zhanna

<p>Today’s puzzle cache turned out to be more interesting than it looked at first glance. While a bit of research made it clear to us the common thread among the people listed in the cache description, and what bit of data we needed to find about each person, there were some ambiguities that led to a large number of possibilities. Enter a quick Python script I wrote to help us try the different outcomes and keep track of what worked and what didn’t! It didn’t take long before we had the “green light” from the Certitude geo-checker.</p>

        <p>Hi, Tri-State Geocachers!</p>

<p>Rich and I had a lot of fun “amassing our data” and eventually getting confirmation from Certitude. We thought the theme was great, but some ambiguities made it more difficult than we expected. The posted hint was a big help. Someday we hope to visit the area to search for the cache.</p>

<p>Thanks for the challenge!</p>

<p>Zhanna and ~Rich in NEPA~</p>
