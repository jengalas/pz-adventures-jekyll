Breakfast: scrambled eggs and oatmeal toast, cranberry juice for me; French toast with powdered sugar (unintended), crispy bacon, coffee for R. at Jeannie's.  After breakfast, still in search of the _Pathmakers_ book, we checked Sherman's bookstore.  Although they have a lot of local history items, they did not have the book.  We then decided to take advantage of the fact that although it was still chilly and wet, it was not actually pouring for once, and we drove to the Sand Beach parking area to hike to Great Head.  The path was wet, many ruts from extreme erosion due to the constant deluge of rain.  At least we stayed mostly dry, until we reached the top and were exposed to the strong winds off the ocean and spray/sprinkles that accompanied them.  The enveloping dampness of the woods was actually quite cozy, and we spent some time on the way up photographing bunchberry plants and on the way down, the violent ocean viewed from within an alcove of trees.

After the hike, we drove to the Schooner Head Overlook, where we hoped to catch a glimpse of the bizarrely-named "Spouting Horn" we'd seen mentioned in some of the books in the Thuya Lodge library.  This was a wild guess on our part, since we had no real idea where we should even look.  Not surprisingly, we did not find anything that resembled the "Spouting Horn" in the photos.

The day was becoming brighter and warmer, so we decided to find "our spot" and lie by the ocean for a while.  The Climbing Mooses figured it out after initially having some trouble reaching the correct spot!  The sun finally started to come out here, and we felt warm for the first time in days.

After resting for a while (and eventually becoming chilled again from the breeze and the spray), we stopped at the Thunder Hole information shack, thinking they might have some information on the Spouting Horn.  The guy there, Zach, had never heard of it, but he did have some information about the cog railway!  He told us where to park and to look in the woods heading up Cadillac for rows of the pegs that held the ties in place.  The path of the railway can be followed much of the way up, he said, eventually crossing Cadillac Mountain Road, until it becomes too overgrown to follow.  Supposedly a cairn a little distance into the woods from the parking area would show us the way.  We made it a point to work this into our plans for later in the day.

Continuing on our little drive, we stopped for a moment at the large stone bridge at Otter Point, which is lovely in the mist. We couldn't resist another stop at Jordan Pond House for the traditional blueberry tea (coffee for R.) and popovers.  We also cannot resist the gift shop!  We bought a little balsam pillow with a moose motif, a silver bracelet with charms (bike and lobster!) and a t-shirt.  Afterward, we made a quick stop at the parking area for the cog railway, trying to scout out where to enter the woods. We would have poked around more had it not been raining, yet again.
