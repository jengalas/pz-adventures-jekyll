We woke to a beautiful sunny day, most welcome for a nice photo walk that we had in mind for the Jesup Path.

After our lobster roll feast yesterday, we were looking for another light breakfast this morning. Unfortunately, Mount Dessert bakery is now closed on the weekends due to loss of staff (went back to school) and desire to keep the quality high. We went back to Slice of Eden, which was very busy around 8am but still pretty efficient. We each got a bagel this time, R had plain with the salmon, red onion, caper cream cheese and I had a salt & pepper again with veggie cream cheese (cream cheese on the side). We brought them back and ate on our porch again. All excellent!

We wrapped up our breakfast and got ready for our day pretty quickly in an attempt to catch the Blackwoods bus to Sieur de Monts. We had no trouble - in fact, we were the only people on the bus, a larger one than usual, I guess they were using them in an attempt to make sur they could accommodate as many people as possible with the limited routes this year. It was so funny when we arrived at the Sieur de Monts parking lot to see the lot completely full and people circling around and around like they do at Jordan Pond House, looking for a spot, when we just got off the completely empty bus.

When I realized we were so close, I really wanted to check on the situation of the Sweet Waters Stone that we found 6 years ago. My local friend Katie reprted last year that she checked the area and thought the stone was gone. It sounded like she had a tiny bit of doubt, though, so I wanted to check on it based on the cooordinates I had saved when we found it. While Rich played with a few compositions around the Sweet Waters Circle, I looped around onto the park road from where it was easiest to access the stone. I worked my way in through the high grass and sweet fern, and sadly confirmed that Katie was correct; the stone is gone. There is only an impression in the ground at that location, and some sparse grass. I took a few minutes to walk around the area (not that it's very easy to do so) and spotted some other cut granite blocks, discarded, and a large depression in the ground that may be natural or may have been afoundation of some kind. Will require more investigation. While I was at the site, I turned to my right to spot a dark snake slithering quickly past and beneath a log! I was thrilled to see one during what we're calling the Summer of the Snakes! I can't tel l what type he was, probably a garter snake althoug I did not notice any stripes (they are not always easily apparent). Could also have been a black racer as they also live in the area.

Back to Rich he said that although he hadn't seen very much while he waited for me, he had found a small USGS survey marker set on the corner of the stone culvert. He had some photos to show me and will be adding them to my site. 

We walked back toward Sieur de Monts where the same cars were still circling, looking for a parking place, and we chuckled to ourselves thinking of the empty bus.

Our plan was simply to hike the jesup Path (basically flooded beneath the boardwalk from all the recent rain) all the way to Great Meadow and then walk Kebo Street back into town. The path was very busy near Sieur de Monts, as expected (it's like the top of Bright Angel Trail at hte Grand Canyon) but although it was much busier than usual, the crowds thinned out he further we went. We walked very slowly, stopping frequently to look for snakes and other critters, to take photos, or simply to watch in silence (a rare commodity these days). Most people just blew right by us, mouths going a mile a minute, not seeing anything. About halfway along the boardwalk section, I spotted a garter snake resting on the wooden support right at Rich's feet! He was so beautiful and stayed still for a long time posing for photos. We showed him to an elderly German-speaking couple who came up to us while we were photographing him. He had had enough by this point and slithered off teh deck and swam away in the water.

Along the way we also saw mushrooms and fungi, dragonflies, and a colorful frog on the gravel-lined section north of Hemlock Road. Some trees are already starting to change to their autumn colors. 

We passed alongside the Kebo Valley Country Club golf course which is always interesting, and was packed today. At one point we heard a sound like a golf ball hitting a tree and a golfer made a omment about "that was some kind of ricochet!" We thought the ball had hit the tree and come back at him, but no, it was actually across the street in a ditch filled with leaves, rocks, and small branches. He chipped out, only for the ball to fly over the fairway and into a water-filled culvert on the course. From one bad lie to another *really* bad one!

Anoter thing that was really amusing to R was the snack cart we passed on the way up the hill to rejoin the trail. I had heard about hot dog carts staffed by young women at country club courses before but it was new to R and he got a kick out of it (note, this particular hot dog cart was not staffed by a young woman but apparently by an old guy). They had snacks, hot dogs and some drinks - I saw hard seltzer for one thing.

While near the course, I also spotted a stone monument holding an NPS disk that I'm pretty sure we haven't recovered before, so we did that before moving on. Futher along the trail, we crossed something that was obviously an old road of some kind. I took coordinates at the intersection and walked west a ways so I could get a tracklog. I'm not sure but it appears to be in the area of the "Red Rock Spring" shown on the old maps just south of Harden Farm Road. I will have to investigate it more, and also investigate Harden Farm Road itself. Vehicles are prohibited from driving down it, looks like maybe there are some park-related buildings at the end? But it doesn't say we can't walk down it, which we would like to do.

And in the sidewalk near Holland Avenue, we spotted a brand new MaineDOT benchmark disk from 2020. We had no idea it was there, but it was another very exciting find!

After this pretty exciting day, we were ready for a rest and then planned on a simple dinner at McKays. I was hungry but waited until 4:45 to walk down to McKays for their opening at 5, only to find a sign posted outside that said "Closed Sat." What?! There was no explanation or indication whether they would be open tomorrow. Either way, we had to find something else for tonight.

As we were relatively close to Havana I suggested that we check there to see if a table might be available. I could hardly believe it when the hostess said that yes, they had one table available on their patio! We're not usually big fans of eating outside (many of the "patios" are afterthoughts and are right alongside the road or parking lot, and are windy and cold). But Havana's is actually internal to the restaurant and more covered than not, so t was perfectly acceptable. What a surprising treat it was! Havana is always one of our best meals on the island but this exceeded everything. We started with the amuse bouche of a thin very mild pickle topped with a flavorful, slightly funky cheese (goat maybe?) and red beets. then the breads came, which are always deliciuos (blueberry cornbread and multigrain) with white bean spread, chili oil, and honey-cinnamon-chive butter. 

We didn't want to be stuffed so we passed on appetizers this time and just went for two entrees. I got the coconut crusted halibut with mango-jalapeno sauce served with sweet potato cakes and crispy kale, and Rich had peruvian chicken with smashed fingerling potatoes and creamy cilantro sauce. Everuthign was truly the best I've had. We each had two mojitos, which also made everything taste even better (and when we left, R noted that yes, it's the same white-bearded bartender they've had for years!).  I really didn't need dessert but could not resist the mango creme brulee. It was worth it! We shared it and both loved the flavors and the crisp sugar crust.

Everyone else seated on teh patio was quiet and polite, even the party of 6 near us (they sounded interesting, in fact, having been involved in some way with pro cycling).
