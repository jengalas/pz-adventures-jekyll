Breakfast was apri-scoats.  Bought a few things at Bean's and then decided to continue on to Moose Point State Park.  I'm not sure what happened last year, when we found nothing at the site, but this time we found the stem of the disk and it was quite apparent what it was.  We looped around on the Moose Trail and back to the parking area, where I stamped my notebook with the MPSP "passport" stamp. Before taking the hike to Moose Point, we took a nice walk on the rocky beach.  Still no real hope of getting close to the MOOSE POINT 2 mark that's deep in the woods.  When we were leaving, R mentioned to the guy at the booth that we wanted our money back because we hadn't seen a moose.  We ended up asking him about the benchmark.  He had a vague recollection of someone mentioning something about it a few years ago, but nothing more than that to offer.  Then, surprisingly, he said "Oh, and I know there's one of those marks at Fort Point, on the pier."  We had no idea what Fort Point was, but it turns out it's another state park nearby, just a few miles off Route 1 in Stockton Springs, the next town up from Searsport.  Fort Point was awesome.  We got to explore the ruins of Fort Pownall, investigate the lighthouse (privately owned) and the oil house, the automated fog bell tower.  We wandered through the wooded trails and made our way to the pier.  We had no idea if the guy even really knew what benchmarks were or if we'd end up finding a plaque or something else unrelated, but a quick look at the pier foundation and we saw a tidal mark, NOS station ().  (It wasn't until later that we found out there are actually a number of marks here, NOS and NGS, so we will have to put them on the list for next year.)  I didn't even get a good photo of the lighthouse, which turns out to be an NGS station, nor the spindle on a ledge out in the bay that I even suspected at the time might be a station.  Don't know why I neglected to get a photo, and now I know that it's an NGS mark and will be on next year's list.

Arrived later than ever, around 3:00pm after all our adventures.  Didn't do much other than go for supper and walk around town!  Fashion Night so there were goodies out to sample, spicy blueberry jam, mustard, etc.  Bought moose welcome plaque!

Dinner: pizza at Rosalie's, large plain, Shipyard summer ale.  Walked around afterward and had sorbet (lime-cucumber and blueberry basil) and ice cream (blackberry and cranberry). Checked out the new "Irish pub" at the new West St. hotel, almost forgot that we had wanted to look for the TIDAL D benchmark.  In the waning light we took a short walk on the Shore Path and spotted it on the ledges.  I have no idea how we hadn't noticed it before, especially since last year I remarked how it would have been such a good spot for a mark, and we knew we were missing at least one of the series.
