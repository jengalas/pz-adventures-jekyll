Part of our plans for today were decided last night when I was investigating some benchmarks we hadn't searched for yet and noticed a "not found" recovery note from JRO from 2018 on C 145 (PE0303). I found the mark on the USGS topo map and scaled coordinates from the map; then I checked the recent Street Views of the area, and I spotted something very close to the coordinates that looked exactly like a disk (round, brown, on a rock face in the right location and facing the right direction, and about the right distance above ground). Rich and I were both nearly convinced that was the benchmark, and we could hardly wait to check it out this morning.

After a large and very filling dinner last night, we weren't in the mood for much of anything for breakfast. We split a small yogurt and a muffin, along with the customary tea, coffee, and orange juice. We took some time to get ready and then headed over toward Southwest Harbor to see if we could confirm our suspicions about the benchmark.
  
It was funny, even on the way over we made a few jokes about perfectly round 4-inch-wide lichen spots having fooled us in the past. Well, guess what happened this time. Yes, as soon as I got out of the car and crossed the road, I could see that the round spot was indeed a lichen. Damn.

We searched the rock cut/outcrop (we're not convinced that it's a rock cut) as thoroughly as possible, but no mark was visible. We agree with JRO that the mark is very likely still here, but covered by moss or vegetation overgrowth. A metal detector would probably be very helpful. If we get a new metal detector, we may try again!

But there was nothing more we could do in this location today. Another idea we had was to drive down to the end of Clark Point Road, also in Southwest Harbor and the site of the famous Beal's Lobster Pound, to search for a series of tidal marks. 

We've known about this series of tidal marks for a long time, probably since I began visiting this area annually in 2005. But for some reason we always thought they would have to be accessed through the Coast Guard property, which seemed unlikely to happen.
  
A few weeks ago, though, we noticed that our reliable professional surveyor JRO, who has left very hepful recovery notes for many marks on the island, had found TIDAL 6 in 2018. He described accessing the beach area via the house neighboring the Coast Guard facility, so that is what we planned to do today.

We walked down the driveway labeled **8 Crows Nest** and knocked on the door of the small house overlooking the beach. A man came to the door immediately. We told him what we were looking for and asked if we could access the shore. He said he was only a renter, but that he had no problem with it. Great!

Rich and I climbed down on the rocks and carefully made our way over to the corner of the retaining wall. We could spot the blue-green disk from a distance. I climbed over to it and then searched for (and eventually found) nearby TIDAL 2 before documenting this disk. TIDAL 6 is the easiest mark of this series to locate, and the only one of the three on this beach that is a disk.

TIDAL 2, on the other hand, was such an interesting mark, and not easy to find! It was fun to find something obviously old (and to actually know what it was) and to find one that surveyor JRO didn't find. I will admit, it took me a few minutes. Given the description, it wasn't exactly clear what I was searching for or what it would look like. But the only likely location was the large ledge southeast of TIDAL 6, where JRO suspected that TIDAL 2 would be set. He was correct about that. There is so much gray and white lichen on this outcrop that the white-oxidized lead slug blends in and hides quite easily. It took me two passes over the outcrop to notice it, and even then, I wasn't sure until I got down close to the mark and noticed the "X" cut in the center and the punch mark that I was sure I'd found a survey mark.
  
We did not really expect to find the third mark on the beach, TIDAL 5, which is a drill hole. Drill holes, in particular, can be notoriously difficult to locate and positively identify after decades of weathering and vegetation growth. But this one was in an obvious location on an obvious rock face, basically glinting in the sun and drawing my attention immediately as soon as I stepped down onto the rocky beach. I also really liked the carved triangle surrounding the drill hole, and the carved horizontal line that runs through it.

It was a luxury to have plenty of time to search for and document the marks. We had permission, and this was a quiet area without cars and trucks flying by or anyone wandering over to us and asking what we were doing. I could have stayed on this peaceful little beach all day! But we were getting hungry.

Beal's Lobster Pound was right next door, and we haven't been there in a few years. Looks like they have really fancied the place up, too, with indoor seating on two levels, and they take reservations now. We briefly considered ordering a lobster roll, but I could tell that Rich really wanted to go back to the Bucking Lobster at the Northeast Harbor Marina, which was fine with me, because the food is always excellent and it's generally a quiet, relaxed environment in the park there. So that is what we did!

We arrived well after noon, and there were a few people roaming around waiting for their orders. I reserved one of the picnic tables for us while Rich waited for our food, which was exactly the same as what we got here on Tuesday: classic lobster roll with chips, lobster quesadilla with awesome salsa and lime crema, and a blueberry lemonade. It was indeed very peaceful while we ate. Even the dog at the table next to us didn't make a peep the whole time. The food was amazing, and really hit the spot (I was starting to get hungry, especially after all of our benchmark hunting this morning). While waiting in line, we were talking with a man from Florida who comes to Maine often and eats a lot of lobster. He recommends Sprague's in Wiscasset, so we will have to check that out sometime.

Where to next? It was still early in the afternoon, so I suggested checking out the section of Southwest Valley Road that I had happened to see while we driving by on Routes 3/198. First, we thought we would stop in at the historical society (just about a tenth of a mile north of the road), if they were open, to see if they knew anything at all about the road.

They were open! And the woman at the desk, Lisa, was happy to look through their resources, although she personally didn't know anything about the road. She pulled out two large maps that I've seen before in _Pathmakers_ (but these were huge - so much easier to read) and we found the road on the map. Then she brought out a copy of _Place Names of Mount Desert Island and the Cranberry Islands, Maine_ and we found references to the road on page 507.

Lisa had to step out, so Rich and I took some time to look around at the current exhibit about schoolhouses on the island. It was fascinating. One thing in particular that I learned was that rural schools often didn't have slate blackboards, but instead a series of horizontal planks on the wall that were painted with blackboard paint (a mixture of several ingredients including shellac, lampblack, emery, and pigment). Two coats were applied, and then the board was wiped down with felt after 48 hours to leave a velvety surface for chalk.

Lisa still hadn't returned, so we waited a few minutes until a woman who had been in a meeting in the back room came out to see if we still needed help. I really just wanted to let them know that we'd found a reference to the road in the book, and also to ask if we could have a copy of the map, since Lisa indicated they had a ton of copies. Not only did we get to take a copy of the one map Lisa had mentioned, but we were also given two others! What a find!

The road itself wasn't so exciting. It is marked private and is basically just a series of driveways. After our experiences the other day on private property I didn't feel comfortable driving around in there at all, so we will probably have to try to find the road from the park end, near Eagle Lake. Just something else to add to the list!

Our final little investigation for the day was to check out the old beaver pond near Eagle Lake. It appears to e turning into a bog rapidly. There are still two beaver lodges but no sign that they are active, and nearly the entire surface of the pond is covered with lilypads. We followed small trails along the northern shore, coming across an old dump site and some sundews, which I know I've seen before when we were poking around here with Angie a few years ago. I was just curious whether they were still here.

We spent the rest of the afternoon reading and working on benchmarks on the porch on this warm day. ARound 4:30, it was time for a light dinner. Rich and I headed into town, where he stopped at Hannaford for some beer while I continued on to order takeout at Rosalie's. It wasn't busy, and in 15 minutes our small cheese pizza was in hand, and 5 minutes of jogging later, I was back at our room with the pizza. It was excellent, even as takeout, and so relaxing to sit and eat together while watching a few videos (Desert Drifter and Sip and Feast, tonight).
