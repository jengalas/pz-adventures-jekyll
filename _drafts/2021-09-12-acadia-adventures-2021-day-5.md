For the second day in a row, the theme is SNAKES! Or at least one SNAKE for today.

We were completely undecided about what to do for breakfast this morning. We considered bagels again from Slice of Eden, but we were both feeling like we might be able to eat something a little bigger, like crepes from Sunrise Cafe, if it wasn't too busy. Only problem was that it's Sunday and we figured it might be busy, since it was almost 8:00 when we started walking downtown. We passed by Slice of Eden and saw only one guy waiting inside, a far cry from yesterday when the line was out the door for hours. We took our chances and were thrilled to see that Sunrise was empty when we got there.

As always the service was friendly and efficient and our crepes arrived within a few minutes of ordering. They were as good as ever, and we chose our standard favorites: veggie lover for R (filled with a delicious salad of onions, tomato, red peppers, avocado, and arugula) and I can never resist the wild Maine blueberry crepe. Standard drinks as well, Ear Grey tea for me and coffee for R. A few people came in and sat at two of the other tables while we were eating, but they weren't overly boisterous.

By the time we finished up and came back outside, it had suddenly become extremely windy. We were surprised that a whale watch boat was attempting to go out, but they were probably as surprised by the crazy wind as we were since it hadn't been in the forecast at all. We walked back through the Village Green to take a few photos of the mint plants that the hummingbirds love so much (would like to plant them!). This was difficult due to the wind, but R managed to take some really nice photos--far better than what's needed for identification! They seem to be an Agastache, otherwise known as hummingbird mint, which makes sense!

In spite of the wind, we thought it might be a nice day to walk the carriage roads and see if we could find anything exciting to photograph. Our plan was to park at the Paradise Hill overlook as we did last time and hike the small shortcut trail in to the carriage roads near Witch Hole Pond (emerging at intersection #3). This worked out fine, although we were a little concerned about leaving our car at the very busy overlook. (I had taken a jog down the road to see if the old pulloff area was available, but it is blocked off and overgrown now, so we had no chance of parking there.) 

There was an NPS volunteer at the overlook and I asked him if he knew a good spot in the park to find snakes. "Snakes?!" he said. "Yeesh, I don't know, I rarely ever see them. Hey, someone saw one yesterday at Sieur de Monts!" "Yeah, I think that was us," I said. Thanked him and moved on.

The little trail was dry, counter to our expectations after such a wet year. It rise quickly from the road and leads through a pine and hardwood forest. We kept an eye out for snakes, but didn't see much other than a few mushrooms lining the path. There is an area of rock ledges and some talus that would make for excellent snake habitat, although I didn't investigate it too much on the way in.

We were torn on which way to turn at intersection #3. Last time we came up along the right-hand carriage road, past Halfmooon Pond and Witch Hole Pond. We decided at first to investigate the other path, the one that leads to our left down the hill and past some low-lying swampy areas. Although it was extemly windy here (blew Rich's hat off in no time) it was still a very pleasant walk, but we ended up not seeing much of anything other than an interesting beaver dam, some dragonflies that were too restless to pose for a photo, and a few mushrooms. We decide to turn around and go down the carriage road by Witch Hole Pond again. We saw more of interest thre last time, and I was really looking forward to checing out the situation at Halfmoon pond again to see if the carnivores were still there and if the pitchers were in bloom.

This part of the cariage road was very busy, but it's wide nough that no one really bothered us. We spotted a monarch butterfly, a bunch mroe dragonflies, some mushrooms (some women asked "areyou mycologists?" To wich R answered "no, but I wish we were. I love mushrooms and would love to know more about them!" I Was thinking, we're apparently herpetologists this week, but check in next week and we may be mycologists. We also saw Indian pipe in the same location we spotted it last time, but these were mostly well past their prime, some already completely dried up, brown husks.

Rich wanted to take it easy today, so he waited about halfway down the carriage road while I continued on toward Halfmoon Pond and the little pond near it. The little pond would be a great spot to sit for a few hours. So much wildlife to see! The plant life is mostly submerged after all the rain lately, so although I could see Sarracenia flowers from the carriage road I couldn't get anywhere near them. I walked through the woods to approach from the side, and this was when I realized what a peaceful, beautiful spot this was. A dozen frogs leapt into the water when I arrived. I could see the flowers and the pitchers almost completely submerged. We will have to come back here with plenty of time to sit and wait.

Halfmoon Pond wasn't nearly as fruitful as it was last year because it was just overfull and the bog plants were submerged. I saw a few Sarracenia flowers here and some pitchers (these are a deep red) but unlike last time, when I could walk right over to them, I couldn't get anywhere near them.

On my way back I stopped at the little pond again when I noticed a strange shiny gray roundish object in the water. I couldn't iagine what it was at first, but then saw that it was a tiny hatchling turtle! So cute and funny! And right next to it was another frog.

I returned to R where he had been resting, watching, and taking some photos further up along Withc Hole Pond. We headed back to the car but it wasn't long before he exclaimed and pointed to the ground. At my feet was a tiny little brow snake!!! Wriggling along like crazy, he was still nice enough to pause here and there for photos. He sayed with us for quite a while, until we led him back off the carriage road to safety. R said he has seen snakes on the carriage roads before, but they were almost always run over. :(

We returned to the car without further excitement or issues, and headed downtown to check out the situation at McKays. I still have no idea what their deal is because they still had the "Closed Sat" sign out after 2pm on Sunday. We chose not to risk it and instead, after cleanign up and resting in the room for a few minutes, went to Side Street again for great lobster roll (I needed to have it and the clam chowder again!) and lobster mc & cheese for R. We both had the Peaks "The Juice" beer again. It was so good! As expected we were too stuffed for dessert.

My only regreat about the day is that I completely forgot to look for the shortcut path between Breakneck Rd and the carriage road at Witch Hole pond! Rich mentioned it this evening and I was bummed that I had walked by twice and not thought to look for it.
