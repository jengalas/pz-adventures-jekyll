Today was mostly a driving-tour day, which for some reason tired us out more than hiking!  We began with breakfast at Two Cats (granola for me and mom, blueberry pancakes for dad, egg sandwich for R).  The day was expected to be stormy, but the morning was very warm and mostly sunny.  Our tour started at Sieur de Monts and the wild gardens, where we saw tiny sundews and large pitcher plants, among other interesting plants, although most of the flowers are gone now (lots more Jack in the Pulpit too). Then we went on to the Precipice, where we watched for people climbing the trail, but only R saw someone right near the top.  We also drove just a bit further to check for climbers on the face, but it was deserted, which is very strange.  Usually parking is impossible to find but there wasn't a single car today.

Next we headed to Sand Beach.  The sun was out fully by now and it was very warm.  I even went in the ocean for a while. We showed mom the trailhead for Great Head but she wasn't interested.  Watched people on the Beehive for a  few minutes too.  Then we went on to Thunder Hole.  Fog began drifting in and it felt chilly all of a sudden!  Dad and I climbed up on the sea stack like last year (remember asshole that was commenting that we weren't smart).  Otter Cliffs, where we saw four more cormorants (we saw two at Thunder Hole but they weren't drying their wings). Then we did Sargeant Drive, but by now the fog was so thick that we couldn't see anything across the sound. STill a nice drive, though.  We then went to the Beech Hill farm stand, where we bought some honey. Then for lobster!  (After picking up a ham sandwich for dad at Cafe Drydock.) Had Chickadee riesling with our lobster.

Drove around past Seawall and Ship Harbor in heavy fog, with breaks of sun here and there.  Still very damp. Bass Harbor Head light, then to Lopaus Point to see Julia Child's old summer cottage.  Then back to town (where it was sunny and even warmer, high 70s) for a bit of a rest before supper, which was pizza and 22oz. Shipyard ales.  For dessert, pink grapefruit sorbet, vanilla milkshake (R) and soft blueberry ice cream (mom and dad).
