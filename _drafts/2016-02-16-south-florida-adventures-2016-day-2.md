Winter strikes, even in Florida! We got a later start than expected due to a line of nasty storms passing through, which were actually part of the same huge winter storm system that had affected us at home the past few days. But when "winter storm" means a few thunderstorms, 80° temperatures, and sunshine an hour later, I can't really complain.

We ate a light breakfast consisting of fruit and a bagel at the hotel, and then headed to the nearby Publix store to pick up some groceries and wait out the storm. We got the delicious guava danish and guava and cheese turnover like last time and a few other essentials. The storm passed while we waited in the parking lot. Then we began heading north (past the cactus farm!) toward the Shark Valley entrance. They must be building a new road because the last few miles were narrow 2 lane with lots of activity on the sides and borrow fill piles lining the roadway. Lots of trucks on this section. We soon turned west onto the Tamiami Highway and began our drive alongside the canal.

After several miles watching the canal birds and lily pads and grasses we turned left toward Shark Valley visitors center. The day was partly cloudy and about 70 degrees, perfect for walking and photos. We took the tram tour immediately upon arriving. The tour guide Gustavo, a local ranger, gave a great 2 hour talk as we rode the 15 mile tram route. As we spotted alligators, wading birds in the river of grass we heard the stories of the native Americans and how they lived in the area on the hardwood hammocks, or tree islands, die to their slightly higher elevations. They had separate islands for sleeping, eating, working, learning trade, etc. There was even a primitive tidal benchmark on a dwarf cypress tree!  The high water mark, updated as necessary, indicated how high they needed to build.

The alligators, of course, were amazing, and we got to see so many in different stages of development from babies, this year's crop, to last year's juveniles. Once they get to a certain age mom kicks them out so they don't eat the new babies. We also learned that you can take down a gator  (so you can use their belly grease as bug repellent) by poking them in their Achilles heel, the hole on top of their head. We also learned (fortunately not firsthand) that dead gators reek horribly. Remember Seminole decoys to lure Jackson's men out to the hammocks where they would be driven off, and the Seminole would retreat into the hammocks. Observation tower built as fire tower on old Humble Oil site, then full observation tower built by park service in 1965. Really cool structure. Trail near it under water at the time but we would like to check it out sometime. Yellow snake.

After the tram ride we spent a lot of time exploring the trail again on foot. Lots of gators, pig frogs oink!, purple gallinule. Otter cave trail also under water. Bobcat boardwalk was very nice way to go between the two parts of the loop trail. Nice plants and lizards. Once on the east side I waded in the water for a short distance. Warm water felt great, muddy and slippery underneath.

Next we looked for three benchmarks nearby. We hadn't made any particular plans in advance to go to Shark Valley, so when Rich suggested it last night, I checked BenchMap to see what marks might be nearby. The first one on our list was an easy find, just 0.2 miles west along the Tamiami Trail (U.S Route 41) from the intersection with the entrance to Shark Valley. T 237 is set into a concrete wall on the east end of a gated discharge structure at spillway S-12 B, north of the highway. The disk is in good condition, although it might be difficult to use since it is situated partially beneath one of the pipes that extends over the spillway structure.

After finding T 237 on the north side of the highway, I crossed over and headed for a triangulation station, FLGPS RON, on the south side. Our camera's battery promptly died right after I took my closeup photos. Damn. But no problem—we had a second battery waiting in the car. As I crossed back over the highway toward the car, I felt something poking my foot, as if a piece of dried grass had gotten stuck in my shoe. Then another. Then ... I looked down and saw my left foot covered with several dozen small brown ants that were, by now, biting ferociously. I yelled "fire ants!" to Rich, who was (sensibly) waiting in the car, and then proceeded to rip off my sandal and bang it repeatedly against the shoulder of the road while hopping around on my right foot and simultaneously trying to brush my left foot free of ants. In retrospect it was quite hilarious (only because I'm not allergic and suffered only the typical painful, but not life-threatening, reaction!).

As you might expect, I had no desire to cross back over to resume taking photos and potentially walk back through whatever nest I had unknowingly disturbed the first time. Hence, the only photos I have are the closeup and an area shot taken from the north side of the highway, near T 237.

The disk is in good condition and is well-marked with red paint on the guardrail and spillway wall; this and the frequency of recoveries indicate that the mark is probably used quite often.

This triangulation station has no associated reference marks but it does have an azimuth mark. The azimuth is located about 1/3 mile west along the Tamiami Trail from the station. It is on the north side of the highway, set into the west corner of the south abutment of a bridge over a canal. The bridge leads north to a Miccosukee Village. Miccosukee Airboat Rides depart from a nearby chickee. The azimuth mark is in good condition.

On the way back to Homestead, we arrived at the cactus farm right at 5:00, closing time, but they still appeared to be open so we went in. Picked out 2 nice ones, one that r had his eye on yesterday  and another neat one. Isabel got us a tray to bring them home in. Only $7 for 2 4 inch cacti. She said she sells 200-300 succulents per 1 cactus but that cacti are her favorite.

Dinner was at the Whistle Stop in the hotel. Very good as before although we learned that the hotel was just bought. No liquor license for new owners yet. R had chicken and dumplings and I had a shrimp and grilled veggie wrap. We shared calamari with lime ginger sauce and lots of water!
