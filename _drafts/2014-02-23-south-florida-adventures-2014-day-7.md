Today was a day of bumming around, a lot of walking, and more good food. We'll start with breakfast, which unfortunately wasn't so great—we had our croissants from yesterday, and I'm sure they would have been fabulous yesterday, but take note: croissants (real ones, anyway) don't keep well. Not to mention, as Rich noted, they had really been in the oven twice because they sat in our hot car for half of the day. We probably won't do that again. 

To begin our day, we parked in the free lot at Higgs Beach. Even on a Sunday morning, there was plenty of space in the lot (I suspect we were up and about far earlier than most other people in this town!). The beach looked gorgeous and inviting, very wide and sandy compared to others in this area. But our first goal was to check out the Southernmost Point monument again, hopefully before the majority of tourists arrived. A few groups beat us there, but before long we were able to have our photo taken at the monument and, more importantly, were able to poke around to search for what remains of the benchmark there (after waiting patiently for a break in the action, and taking some photos for other groups). Unfortunately the disk is gone (it was last seen in 2008), but the stem is still in place and the impression left by the disk is still apparent in the concrete. It's always sad to see this. The benchmark has been marked Destroyed in the NGS database, and it's very unlikely that it will be replaced.

We checked out Ana's Cuban Cafe on our way to the White Street Pier. It looked promising, and we considered going there for lunch.

At the pier there were four benchmarks to search for. The first was very easy to find; I knew exactly where to look because I had "cheated" and spotted it before on Google Street View. The others were a bit more challenging, partly because of another mixed-up recovery from the Power Squadron. 

While resting on a somewhat-shaded bench, I took a look for some nearby lunch places. I had heard good things about a Cuban place called El Siboney; we realized they opened for lunch in about 20 minutes and we were about a 15 minute walk away, so it sounded perfect.  Along the way we stopped at the West Martello Fort, which is now the site of beautiful botanical gardens maintained by the Key West Garden Club. We wanted to find out how extensive the site was. When we realized it was over 1.5 acres, we decided to come back after lunch and spend the afternoon exploring the gardens and fort.

Lunch at El Siboney was a great experience! We were thirsty from our walk and found that iced tea with lime wedges was the perfect refreshment. We also shared a pork sandwich with sautéed onions, a ropa vieja (shredded beef) sandwich with tomato pepper sauce, and a HUGE platter of fried ripe plantains! It was hilarious how enormous the pile of plantains was. Somehow we managed to eat almost all of them. I'm so hooked on them now.
