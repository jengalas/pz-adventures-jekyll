From an email message: I decided to spend some time away from the computer this morning thinking that maybe that was the cause of my headache and stiff neck, but I guess it wasn’t since I still have it.  I went back to bed for a while, and then took a little trip out to Promised Land.  I was kinda considering it for one of the cache ideas I had—but again, now that I’ve seen the place I’m not excited about it.  Plus, I’d have to get DCNR “permission”.  But I did find a letterbox while I was there, and then I went for a little run on some of the trails.  Just trying to clear my head, and I thought it might make me feel better.  It did for a little while, but now I feel achy again.
