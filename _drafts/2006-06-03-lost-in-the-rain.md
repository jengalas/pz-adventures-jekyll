> I'm writing this from the future: April 2, 2023. Last night, while watching an episode of "The Curse of Oak Island" that featured wide stone walls. Rich paused the video, turned to me, and asked "Wasn't there a hike we did where we were walking between these very wide, high stone walls?" I had had a similar vague memory, but didn't recall enough of it to even mention it. 
> 
> This simple question led to an evening of investigation into my notes, our photos and tracklogs, and eventally archived email messages. A message I had sent to the geocacher "Papadadio" in June 2006 was enough to help us crack the case. 
> 
> We finally figured out that the place with the wide stone walls was the Indian Hill loop trail in Sterling Forest State Park, which we hiked on May 29, 2006. That same message mentioned a hike we did the following day, to Black Mountain in Harriman State Park. 
> 
> From there, Rich and I were determined to figure out just what happened on that rainy day when we got a bit lost at Rockefeller State Park Preserve—another day-hike for which I had very sparse notes and we had almost no photos. What follows is what we were able to piece together from the notes, email messages, and other clues we were able to find. 

We've been having so much fun lately choosing hikes from "50 Hikes in the Lower Hudson Valley" and spending our days off exploring new areas. Today, however, began with cloudy conditions that threatened rain, and made it very difficult to get motivated to travel anywhere. After several emails back and forth, Rich and I finally decided to take a drive to the east side of the Hudson River and explore the Rockefeller State Park Preserve.

This was attractive to us for a few reasons: the park features wide-open carriage roads which would be pleasant enough to walk even in moderate rain (with proper gear), and it just so happens that these carriage roads were built by John D. Rockefeller, who built the very similar carriage roads that we love in Acadia. The Preseve even features a "13 Bridges Loop" evocative of Acadia's "Seven Bridges" section of carriage roads near Aunt Betty Pond.

Following the hike outlined in the "50 Hikes" book, we parked at the parking area just off Route 117, and went through the tollbooth onto the trails.  We followed the Old Sleepy Hollow Road Trail southwest from the parking area until we reached the turnoff for the Eagle Hill Loop. This is a short jaunt up and around a small knoll. We stopped here at a large boulder to share a snack ("cheese curls!!!") and this is where the warm misty conditions suddenly turned to pouring rain. We decided that we might as well continue on our planned route. It was warm, and as long as we could stay warm and relatively dry, we figured the walk would be pleasant enough.

Once back on the trail from our detour to Eagle Hill, we crossed the highway and wandered north along the Thirteen Bridges trail. It loops up to the north and then back south again, the thirteen bridges crossing Gory Brook as the trail (carriage road) passes back and forth over the brook on the second half of this loop.

We passed beneath Route 117 and turned onto the Witch's Spring Trail. We made another quick detour to Spook Rock (how could you not?!) and found it to be a large, flat-topped boulder that would be a perfect snack or picnic spot on a dry day. Today, everything was just too soggy, and we preferred to keep moving.

We returned to the Witch's Spring Trail and continued south. Somewhere here, after the bridge just south of this trail, is where we got mixed up. Even the trail guide indicates that the signage in this area is poor, although we weren't following the guide turn by turn because we didn't want to keep it out in the rain. T

Rockefeller State Park Preserve.  Warm, lovely walk in misty conditions, then pouring rain.  Shared a snack ("cheese curls!!!") and then the rain began.  Stopping and starting all day long.  Got lost on the carriage roads during the worst part of the rain.  (Give directions from woman and man and show which way we went.)  Still very cozy and fun day.   Excellent dinner at the Mexican restaurant - flautas and steak and flaming pears!!! (Guadalajara?)

Rockefeller State Park Preserve:

6/4/06: I didn't have a chance to try to figure anything out yet.  I'm certainly still curious.  Where do you think we went wrong?  Did we make a wrong turn?  

Well, it’s hard to tell exactly.  The very point where we went wrong is the only part I’m not absolutely sure of (and would like to discuss with you, because maybe together we’ll be able to work it out for certain).  I have a guess that we made a wrong turn after the bridge just south of the Witch’s Spring Trail, and I can see exactly where we ended up after we made the mistake, but I don’t see or recall just what we did at the screw-up point.


6/4/06: You're probably right.  Just wondering if you found that hill/field with the winding trail down it to the underpass at Sleepy Hollow Road.

Yep!  Actually, that was the first thing I found, and then I traced our route back from there.  Everything kinda makes sense now—except why there were no trail or boundary markers, and why the map excluded so much!

I can't think of any places where we were off the trail, other that at Eagle Hill Loop when we sat at the rocks and had a snack.
