Drive back to PHX from Blythe - no problems, got an early start. Had to get gas and found shell station not far from the rental car return area. 
Turned in the car, didn't say anything, then went to airport
Craziness because of huge planes in the tiny gate area, people crammed in and standing everywhere
Some flights delayed which made it even worse - the flight to Charlotte was very late and they eventually brought out sandwiches and snacks for them, which didn't seem like a good sign. However, they finally boarded (again) and got moving not long afterward.  
We had some delays getting moving, and there was insanity in Philly with an asshole guy forcing his way up from the back and tossing people aside yelling "Get outta my way! Get OUTTA my way!" 
No real problems on the final flight, just glad it wasn't full so the huge family could each have 2 seats and no one was stuck next to them.
Dad picked us up as planned and it was FREEZING and horribly windy (does this sound familiar!?)
