Today began (and ended) cold and windy! What a change from earlier this week. At least it's clear and sunny all day. We were planning to eat crepes at the Sunrise Cafe this morning, but after a cold, windy walk there, we found that the place was completely full. There are only 4 or 5 tables, and all were occupied by people who had just received their orders. So it would take a long while, and there was no possibility of eating outside because it was just so windy. And the line was growing longer by the minute. Regretfully, we decided to bail and try the Black Friar instead. 

Fortunately we had the dining room at the Black Friar all to ourselves. The front room was probably packed, although we didn't hear much noise coming from there.  It was reasonably well lit and much warmer than being outside! Service was a little rushed (it was the same server we had on Monday evening, and he seemed flustered). I saw a variety of Eggs Benedict on the menu, and I knew right away that's what I would get. (I ordered the portobello mushroom Benedict.) Rich ordered a veggie omelet, and Dad got the granola parfait with fresh fruit, two eggs, bacon (which he doesn't eat) and a large blueberry muffin. Everything was quite good and we left full and satisfied!

Our plan for today was to get a bus (really two buses) to Sieur de Monts and hike the Hemlock Trail to the Kebo Mountain ridge trail north, and then take the staircase "shortcut" through the woods down to the Stratheden Path, which we would take back to Sieur de Monts. 

On the bus from the visitors center, though, the bus driver happened to mention the Emery Path, which we haven't hiked in a few years and thought it would be nice to see again and to show dad. It's lined with stone steps most of the way, and is a very impressive example of trailbuilding. We would hike up part of the Emery Path, turning off onto Homans Path rather than following Emery all the way to the Schiff Path and ultimately the summit of Dorr. There are beautiful cliffside views from Emery, and we sat to enjoy them for quite a while. Hiking down Homans, which is mostly lined with similar stone steps, was a bit more rugged, likely due to the rocky and muddy sections at the very top. After that, it was smooth going, although there were some large steps along the way. There are also two stone "tunnels" to walk through which we found very interesting. 

Just before the first of these tunnels, a group of three women from Alabama caught up to us. They were curious about the trail and whether they were actually on the correct path (they were). We told them a bit of what we knew about the path and where we're from, and we all mentioned how there seem to be so many Southerners vacationing on MDI this year. Everywhere we go we're hearing southern accents rather than New England/Boston/New York like we usually hear, and they commented that yes, everyone they knew had come to Maine this year!

We made our way back to the intersection with the Jessup path to have a drink and a snack, and the ladies came along a few minutes later. We showed them where the Jessup Path was and explained how they could take any of the trails back from the Park Loop Road. We then proceeded along the Hemlock Road toward the hemlock Trail, which we would follow up to Kebo ridge.

Not long after we started walking, Dad said "ooh!" and pointed ahead of himself—a snake! It was a sweet little 14-inch maritime garter snake, very beautiful but also very active, right on the trail but already moving off to the side by the time we spotted him. Rich tried to get into position for a photo, but the little snake was too quick and he disappeared into his little cave beneath a rock before we could get very close to him. Rich got to touch him, at least! This was our third snake encounter of the trip.

After that excitement, we continued on and then turned up onto the steep Hemlock Trail. It is rocky and steep with some steps and stairs to climb, but it's relatively short. We connected with the Kebo Mountain trail and headed north. I have to say that the trail here is not marked very well, at least northbound. Even in spite of having done this trail in 2019, we still got off track twice and had to backtrack to find the actual trail. There are many "false trails" (probably made and subsequently followed by other misdirected hikers) through some of the scree fields, and the lack of blazes for the northbound hiker makes route finding here challenging, although all you really need to do is get up to the ridge, so there is no real danger of actually getting lost. 

The hike along the ridge was easier and quite short because we only needed to go about .2 miles before we would reach the point where we would turn down into the woods to find the steps. Finding this spot was challenging because although I had a tracklog and waypoints from my previous visit to work from, the limited accuracy of the GPS in these wooded areas makes it difficult to pinpoint something as small as a cairn or a single stone step. We made our way through; even though it's steep the worst part was at the top and then it became much easier as we neared the bottom. It's only about 600 feet and while that can feel like a mile in rough terrain, it really wasn't that bad.

We walked back on Stratheden. When we reached the Hemlock Road, dad decided that he wanted to walk back to town via the Jesup Path and Kebo Street. Rich and I decided to return to Sieur de Monts and take the Blackwoods bus back to the village green.

We ended up getting on the Blackwoods bus on its way out rather than its way back, but that was OK because we got to pass by the Burning Tree and also get a view of the campgrounds, which we haven't yet seen this year. We were back at the village green by 3:10 and chatting with dad on his porch by 3:20. We decided on Side Street Cafe for supper and we would meet around 4:20.

That worked out fine. Side Street wasn't yet too busy, although it was still very loud!. Dad just had water to drink, but Rich and I started with beers (The Juice for me, which I enjoyed there last year, and Liquid Rapture for Rich). I got the lobster roll which comes with clam chowder for some reason, and the chowder came out first. I have to say that it's excellent. Then our meals came: chicken sandwich for dad and burger for Rich, and lobster roll for me. Note: the fries here are very good, fresh cut and no batter or coating, and you can get them without salt or seasoning of any kind.

At one point we thought we might go for ice cream, but it was so windy and chilly when we got outside that we decided to save that for another night. Dad stopped at Hannaford on the way back and we came directly back to the room.
