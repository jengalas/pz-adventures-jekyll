I woke up just a little nervous about the 5K race this morning. Of course I was thinking of it as just an activity, not a race, which helped. But I still wanted to be able to complete it and not come in dead last.

We woke up just before 6:00am, got ready, and left the room to head downtown to the start line just before 7:00am (the race was to begin at 7:45). It was a chilly 48 degrees, but I wasn't too concerned having run the West Street hill last week - I knew I would warm up quickly, and any remaining chill in the air would be welcome.

A few people were already hanging around near the start line at Table Salt (formerly China Joy) when we arrived. A few were jogging and stretching, but most people were just hanging around chatting. I spotted a lady wearing a t-shirt that I could have sworn said Scranton 4 Ukraine 5K. The "Scranton" part was partially covered by her jacket, so I had to ask, thinking it would be so cool if she was from our area. TUrns out that she is from New York but has been coming down for the past few years in August to run the Ukraine fundraiser race. Cool! Maybe I'll try it next year and meet her there. I also learned that she is 69 and only began running at age 60. Very inspirational!

It was time to line up, and most of us were poised and ready to start our watches at the moment we began running. After a brief countdown, we were off!

I felt pretty strong immediately, and the downhill along Main Street gave me an extra boost, but more than anything I kept telling myself just to go easy, pace myself, and not wear out in the first half. I had a feeling I would be able to keep a steady pace on the West Street hill, and probably gain something there.

And that is what happened. I crossed the wide intersection at West and Route 3 (one of two places on the course where police were managing traffic) and immediately noticed that nearly everyone I could see on the hill ahead of me was walking. I just kind of chugged past them, in some cases putting out more speed than I wanted to just so I wasn't breathing down someone's neck like a creep, and got up the hill quickly. Then the course levels off for a short stretch before the next climb on Cleftstone up to Eagle Lake Road. Then from there we crossed over Eagle Lake Road (the second place with police coverage) and after the stretch of very slightly rolling hills along Cromwell Harbor Road (where I spotted three turkeys alongside the road), flew down to the finish!

This was a little strange because it appeared that the way they were directing runners into the park was blocked by orange cones. A woman just ahead of me kept running straight, which confused me and someone behind me briefly, but I didn't see any other way to get into the park, so I just followed the arrow and then noticed that the path turned and went right into the park and straight toward the finish line. It was a thrill to run down that final stretch! I was looking around for Rich but didn't spot him until I had already crossed the line. 

I hadn't been watching my time so I had no idea how I had done (and the automatic readout wasn't working for the 5K, only for the half marathon) so it was a real surprise to check my watch and see that I had made a personal best at 30:00 on the dot. It was even more of a surprise a little while later when they called my name for second place in my age group! That was the last thing I expected, but it was honestly exciting. I always say "I'm a mathlete, not an athlete" and I had never competed in any kind of athletic competition before in my life, so it really was yet another "first" here in Maine. And to come back with two medals made it even better. The best part was having Rich there at the finish, though, as a former half marathoner himself, cheering me on. (And the caramelized pear ice cream compliments of MDI Ice Cream was also pretty amazing, I have to admit. :grin:)

I met up with Judy again after the medals were awarded. She thought she was slow, and yet she had come in third in her age group! She just does it for fun too, but let's be real, it's still a nice little boost to know that you can hold your own among competitors.

On our way back we took Ledgelawn Avenue again, and came down Holland. As we were approaching our hotel, a plump woman in a white sundress popped out of the bushes and into the parking lot for the adjoining motel. OK, we thought ... maybe she thought she was taking a shortcut (not sure where from or where to), or maybe she just really had to pee and was desperate. In any case, it appeared quite bizarre.

We enjoyed a long, leisurely refuel with orange juice, tea and coffee, and another blueberry muffin, and great conversation, while sitting outside on the porch. Rich wanted to take it easy and work on some of the photos from the morning, and I wanted to spend some more time in the sunshine, so I figured I would go on a walk around town and see if I could pick up a few goodies for Elaine, dad, and people at work. I made a nice loop through town, starting down on Cottage Street and going up Main to pick up, first, a few more blueberry-mango jams for Elaine. I checked all of the Acadia shops along the way, but never found seedless strawberry jam for dad - the only thing he said he wanted - even though there were strawberry offerings from a few different companies. I also bought blueberry butter and blueberry honey for Sam and Mary.

My walk around town also included a check of Havana's current menu, as posted on the outside of the restaurant (still the summer menu), a walk past the Flowered Apron (no indication that they are still doing bakery items on Saturdays), a check on Lucreatia's headstone (still there, lying on the ground), and a stop in the Rock & Art Shop (still incredibly bizarre, but fascinating). They still have the mounted snake skeleton, but the snake art piece from a couple years ago is gone, hopefully sold.

Sweaty from my quick walk in full sun, I arrived back at the room in plenty of time to clean up and take a little rest before we headed out again just before 3:30pm for dinner.

Dinner at Havana is always something special, but tonight it was an absolute treat, even better than anticipated for some reason. We arrived a little early for our 4:00pm reservation, and checked out Everyday Joe's (where Rich bought his coffee this morning) and Porcelli's on the way (the simmered octopus and halibut risotto sounded really good)! 

Before they opened the door at Havana, we pored over the menu (again) trying to figure out what to choose. Everything looked so good! We knew we couldn't handle this much food, but we would have loved to try both the farm and summer salads, at least three of the appetizers, several of the entrees, and one dessert had guava coulis so that would be the one for me. Rich was interested in the pork dish but it was listed as chicharones, and we were unsure if they would be too fatty for him to really enjoy.

When we walked in, we were led to our favorite table in the front window (that we had requested when we made the reservation online) and we were so surprised to see an anniversary card waiting there on the table for us! Such a nice touch. Our server, Leo, also wished up a happy anniversary when he greeted us.

Leo soon brought out the evening's amuse bouche, which was a tasty bite of cucumber round topped with a passionfruit mascarpone and honey-cinnamon glazed apple slice. It was refreshing, and I could have eaten a whole plate of them. 

Our mojitos and the bread basket came next. The Italian bread and standard blueberry cornbread were served with a choice of rosemary-infused olive oil, black bean hummus, and honey-cinnamon butter. Rich _really_ liked the black bean hummus, and suggested that we try making it at home.

Next came our appetizers: the usual mushroom spring rolls, which are pure umami wrapped in a crispy shell. I could eat about 20 of those, too. And we tried something new for this year, the brisket tostada (topped with mango and crispy onions - I keep saying that if I see mango as part of a dish, I order it regardless). We were concerned that it would be messy to cut the crisp tostada shell in half so we could share it, but it actually worked out really well. It cut through cleanly, and the brisket was so tender that the entire dish was just a pleasure to eat. The slight smokiness of the brisket went so well with the fruit and onions, too.

Our entrees were next, and they were beautiful as well! We shared the halibut in green curry sauce with crispy roasted potatoes, and pork chop with annatto crema, roasted potatoes, eggplant, and pickled onions. Both were larger portions than we were expecting, but as always, not too filling, but just right. We savored every bite, Rich being extra careful with the pork! And somehow we still had room to share a dessert, and another drink. For the drink, we tried the New Cuban, similar to a mojito with the flavors of lime and rum and topped with a mint leaf, but not sweet. And the dessert was the one I've had my eye on all week: the ricotta buñuelos with guave coulis. (Remember what I said about mango? The same goes for guava.) I didn't even know what buñuelos were but I had to try that guava sauce.

Well, it turns out that they are heavenly little fritters, essentially like fried dough but much lighter than what I've had in the past, steaming hot (Rich even likened their interior texture to that of popovers) and rolled in cinnamon sugar. And of course served on top of a generous amount of guava sauce. SO delicious. I could have eaten 10 of them. (See the theme here.) As an extra nice touch, the chef had written Happy Anniversary across the top of the plate in chocolate, too. Hey, it's much better than being sung to!

On our walk back from Havana, wouldn't you know it ... as we approached our hotel, the same plump woman in the same white dress pushed her way out of the bushes again, this time walking across Holland Avenue toward the townhouses on the other side of the road. I have absolutely no explanation for this.
