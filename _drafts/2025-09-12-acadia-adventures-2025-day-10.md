Breakfast for this morning was waiting for us in the fridge: the blueberry-cheese and raspberry-cheese pastries we purchased yesterday at the Sugar Bakery. Although it was another cold morning, we bundled up and sat on the porch as usual for breakfast. With coffee and tea, we were warm enough for a while. The pastries were still quite good after a day, and we cut them in half to share as always. It was just enough for a morning treat.

We've been so curious about what happened with the Asticou Inn (now the Asticou Hotel?) after seeing the major construction work going on last year while we were here. According to what we saw online, the place has been turned into a resort, essentially, with the inn refurbished and large "cabin" homes taking the place of where the strange alien pods used to be. We thought we would take another stroll along the Asticou Stream Trail to check it out.

The trail was similar to when we explored it last year, although the lack of rain this year has made the woods drier and somewhat less colorful. The tide was out, so we were able to explore more of the small cove where we noticed some large boulders and neon green algae last year. The sun felt so warm and it was very welcome on this otherwise chilly and windy morning.

We took the sharp right turn on the trail and headed up behind the new "cabins." We felt a bit like creepers, but no one seemed to be staying in most of the cabins at this time, and no one said anything to us. We soon popped out onto the road where we could see the various names of the cabins, which were quite neat. There was #1, the Fish Monger; #2, the Beekeeper; #3, the Arborist (I thought at first it said Arsonist!), and a bunch of others like the Conservationist, the Herbalist, and the Gardener. My first thought was that we could create some kind of interesting puzzle here, even a geocache where the names corresponded to the numbers needed to find the coordinates. 

As we walked, we noticed that the place seemed strangely deserted, although some people are clearly staying here. The main inn/hotel building looks similar to the way it used to, at least from the outside, but it was clearly remodeled because we saw it last year with only its "bones" showing. We arrived at 10:35am, 5 minutes after breakfast ended and almost an hour before lunch began, so we knew we wouldn't even have a chance to try the popovers, if they even have them (I had heard earlier in the summer that they did not, but it wasn't clear whether they were planning to put them back on the menu in the future). No menu was posted anywhere that we could see.

We walked inside and wandered out on the porch to check out the view. Well, it certainly was exotic! And not as tacky as I'd been expecting. I guess I was thinking it would have a Vegas vibe, but it honestly still "felt" mostly like MDI, if just a bit over the top. I could do without the palm trees around the pool, really.

Back inside the inn lobby, we enjoyed looking through a case of ephemera and oddities on display, that included some stereograms of the area, turtle shells, old novels, two small alligator skulls, a preserved luna moth caterpillar, and more. I also saw a print on the wall of the staircase heading down that really struck me, although I don't know why.

Noticing that it was almost 11:00am, and that we were so close to the Northeast Harbor Marina, we just had to take a drive over there once again for some more lobster rolls. We were the first to arrive but the second to order since it took us a while to decide. But of course we went for the lobster bahn mi rolls again! And we got fries with both orders this time, along with another blueberry lemonade. We sat in the sun at the same table we had the other day. The whole experience was blissful - the warmth of the sun, the tender lobster, the slight spiciness of the sauce, and perfect company. I didn't even want to move! But we eventually worked our way back to the car, and then decided to spend a few minutes down at the boat ramp before heading out of the marina. We didn't see too much other than the usual collection of boats in the harbor and a squawking collection of gulls that gathered at the top of the ramp.

Our final activity for the morning/early afternoon was to search for a few MaineDOT benchmarks that are supposed to be clustered near the small bridge west of Long Pond. We had no luck with any of them, and will have to try again another time, after doing some more research. Most of the utility pole numbers didn't match up, and we didn't spot any large ledges where they were supposed to be. I did, however, find and begin to follow a well-worn trail heading from behind one of the large outcrops that continued on into the woods much farther than I went. (Rich was waiting for me and had no idea I'd found a path, so I didn't want to be gone long. But I did walk far enough to hopefully get a decent tracklog to see where the trail might lead.) We also parked at the lot for the Harbor Brook Trail, which we didn't realize is not open to dogs. So that right there makes it appealing, and we may try it one of these days.

We were initially thinking that we would stay out until 2:00pm so we could drive by the YMCA and I could pick up my packet for tomorrow, but even after driving around through the park, it was only 1:00pm, and it was already getting very busy. We decided just to go back to the room, and maybe order some dinner and pick it up a bit later while also getting the packet on the same trip. And that worked out great! We were both in need of vegetables, so we ordered a Greek salad from Limon Grille, along with a grilled fish sandwich and phyllo "cigars." I picked up my packet, which only took a few minutes because there was no one in line for the 5k, just the half marathon. And then Rich parked alongside the Limon Grille (kind of made his own spot on the side street next to the restaurant, behind the cars that were there) and I went in to pick up the order. It was just being placed into the bag when I arrived, so our timing was just right. They only had one IPA available so we substituted a blueberry ale, which turned out to be excellent. (Wyman's blueberries - I told rich about how I'd heard of them, and that they were the only wild blueberries available to us at home [frozen, of course]).

We ate on the porch as usual, and everything was perfect, just what we were looking for! Lots of veggies, eveyrthing fresh, and the grilled fish sandwich was amazing. It was so tender and flaky and had a savory crust of some kind that was just so good. Whatever yogurt-based sauce they use is also perfect to tie the flavors together.

The rest of the evening was spent relaxing and resting up, wathcing a few videos (and, I admit, eating a chocolate chip cookie or two from the hotel lobby), and working on notes and research.
