We are in Philly, got here without problems.

David Maher, Feb 17, 2014, 8:01 AM
Good.  Was flight smooth?

You, Feb 17, 2014, 8:20 AM
It was a little bumpy but ok. Cold when we got on but warmed up a little.

You, Feb 17, 2014, 12:34 PM
Arrived in Miami a few minutes ago. Waiting for bags.

David Maher, Feb 17, 2014, 12:36 PM
Wow you're early.  Do you know the temp?  Any snacks on the plane?

You, Feb 17, 2014, 1:03 PM
Yes very early for some reason. About 76 degrees. No snacks just drinks.

David Maher, Feb 17, 2014, 1:07 PM
Okay, send a note when you get there and settled.

I feel sad because of our Petal passing.  She sure did have a lot of friends and was loved.  The Whites should get another one or two goats.

You, Feb 18, 2014, 9:51 AM
I think so too. We are very sad.
We had wine called Goats will Roam last night, and plantain chips in memory of her.

David Maher, Feb 18, 2014, 9:56 AM
That's a nice tribute.  Everything well there?

You, Feb 18, 2014, 5:24 PM
Everything is good other than missing Petal of course. We are at the Green Turtle now going to have supper. Were at Long Key State Park earlier.
I shared my location with you on classic Hangouts (https://hangouts.google.com).

David Maher, Feb 18, 2014, 5:27 PM
I'll see if Green Turtle has a website/menu.  How was the state park?  Now 32 here but ice in the AM.  I'll be going to your house after diner and oatmeal.

State park was very nice, mangrove and lots of other neat plants, even some cactus. The restaurant was very good. Key lime pie for dessert.
And you would have liked the breakfast spot. Bob's Bunz. Sticky buns, turnovers, key lime bundt cake.
