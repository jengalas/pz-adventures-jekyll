"I'm just a common rough woodlouse!"

Today was dad's departure day, always a sad one, but even though things were different this year I'm glad he had a fun time and lots of good food. Like us, he was really eager to get away for a short while. He had been asking to have breakfast at the Black Friar, so even though we were stuffed we decided to try it. Their breakfasts are always great but very large. I got a short stack of two blueberry pancakes, Rich had eggs over medium with toast, extra-crispy bacon, and home fries, and dad had the parfait, which for some reason also comes with eggs, bacon, and a large blueberry muffin. I think everyone was plenty full after that! The restaurant was busy but not packed, probably due to the outdoor seating they now have. 

Dad had everything ready and left right after breakfast. Rich and I headed off to Barr Hill not long afterward.

After seeing all the cars filling the parking areas and lining the roads along our way, and remembering what it was like last week, I was a little concerned what the situation would be at the beach parking lot, but fortuantely there was only one other vehicle parked there. We got a nice corner spot and were gathering our gear when an older couple approached us to ask if we knew anything about the Seaside Path. We did, although we haven't hiked it in a few years, before the recent (2017-2018) updates to lengthen and improve the trail. They thanked us and we headed on to Barr Hill, with them following behind (and then continuing on straight up Seaside Lane after we turned onto the Barr Hill path). 

We hiked up along this very quiet, heavuly wooded path just like last year, enjoying the twists and turns, rock cairns, and, this year, plentiful mushrooms and the occasional slime mold. We spotted a curved rock wall/foundation that we somehow walked right by last year. We crossed hte first grass carriage road and headed back into the woods. A short section of the trail here was overgrown with blueberry bushes, much higher than last time when we had a drier year. We soon emerged on another carriage road that we would normally cross and continue north on the path to Barr Hill Summit, but this time we decided to take the long carriage road loop around the hill, past the Abby Rockefeller Gardens, which look beautiful (As much as we can tell) but are private and reservations usually close before we arrive here or very soon after, so we haven't yet had a chance to visit.

When we passed by the trail up to Lookout Ledge, I took a quick run up there to create a tracklog, continuing the loop from last time, and then came back down to meet Rich at the carriage road and continue north. These roads are breathtakingly beautiful and peaceful, and would be perfect for misty day photography. We will definitely be back here!

We soon came to the intsersection with the east-west carriage road that passes between Barr Hill and Redfield Hill, which we took over to intersection #31 (new signs here!). We waited until no one was nearby to enter the supposedly restricted grass carriage road that would take us back south toward the first segment of the Barr Hill trail. This was another very quiet, beautiful path featuring HUGE slugs! and some nice mushrooms. I just wish I had some idea whether these are truly restricted from walkers or just cyclists. My friend Angie has given us some hints about where to hike in this area and she never mentioned anything about it being restricted. there is also no indication at the point where the Barr Hill trail (or the other one that goes down to Stanley Brook Road) crosses that you aren't to walk on the carriage roads.

The loop was quicker than I expected, and we were back at the car around 12:45.

At one point we realized that it would be a nice idea, once the buses are back in full service, to take one to Seal Harbor Beach, start climbing Barr Hill, then take a right at grass carriage road and hike to intersection with park carriage roads, then left to intersection with Redfield Hill Trail. Hike Redfield Hill toward carriage roads around Jordan Pond, take bus back. It would probably also work to park at Seal Harbor Beach as we did today, hike to Jordan Pond and then get the Jordan Pond bus back to the parking lot at the beach, if the bus still goes in that direction in the future as it used to.

We had about an hour before our reservations at Asticou, so we drove up Stanley Brook Road and into the park, passing by Jordan Pond House just to see what the parking lot was like (as crazy as you would imagine, and then some). Rich had a thought that he would like to take a photo of the new toll houses at the base of Cadillac Mountain, but when we went by there was simply nowhere to park. All parking spots alongside the road were blocked off and marked for authorized vehicles only.

We turned around and headed back toward NEH, and arrived just a few minutes early at Asticou. We got a nice table outside on the balcony, as always, overlooking the gardens and harbor. The bees flying around were a bother, but didn't really bother us, and even less so when we got our food, for some reason. We started with the customary popovers with strawberry jam, and both ordered Lunch IPA. (Tea and popovers is great, but so is beer and popovers!) We then split a lobster roll with fries, and a "cranberry cobb salad" that had grilled chicken, blue cheese, blueberries and avocado over greens and microgreens in a very light vinaigrette dressing. Everything was delicious, and it's always so peaceful to eat here. It was only moderately busy, much less so than we had expected.

Driving back was by way of Sargent Drive, which takes us along the eastern shore of Somes Sound, very close to the edge in spots for an excellent view. We were reminded of the time we took a nature cruise up into the sound. While driving up Eagle Lake Road on our return to Bar Harbor, I suggested we make a quick stop to look for the benchmark we've been trying to find for years now. A local surveyor found it a few years ago and added better coordinates to the datasheet, so even though it seems a bit like cheating we would like to try it again. Unfortunately this itme we were looking for a fire road that shows up on the maps but not in reaity. It must have been grown in years ago. We went by slowly and turned around a few times, but couldn't find a good place to park on this crazy road. I think it will be easier having a better idea where to stop, and maybe we can try again the next time we go by.

Our plan all along was to have a very small/light dinner, so of course it was ice cream. After a little nap we headed over to MDI Ice Cream, which somehow wasn't busy, and each got a single scoop. Rich got peach and I got a combo of coriander-lemon curd and blueberry basil sorbet. We sat on a nearby bench in the park while someone played jazz piano on the community piano in the gazebo, and we talked about the old restaurants in town. Finally we recalled the name of the restaurant on the corner before Cherrystones - Parkside. It was wine-o-clock pretty early tonight!
