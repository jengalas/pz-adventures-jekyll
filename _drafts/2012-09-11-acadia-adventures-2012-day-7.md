Breakfast was blueberry cheese danish and the one remaining apri-scoat, which was somehow still in good shape after almost a week, tea and coffee at the gazebo.  Then we decided to make our way toward SWH for lobsters, stopping along the way in NEH to hike around the schoolhouse Ledge area and lower Hadlock Pond.  We couldn't find the way in at the first parking area for Schoolhouse Ledge (at least where it appeared on the map) but we parked near Digby Lodge at Lower Hadlock Pond.  Walked around the east side of the pond and got onto the NEH trail system toward Schoolhouse Ledge.  Neat area with totally moss-covered, soft singletrack trails with old fashioned wooden signs.  Very neat!  We went quite a way but then decided to turn back and complete the loop around the pond.  we'll explore the rest of the area at another time.

We then went for lobster!  While we were waiting my father called to say he was at the visitor's center, but it was the wrong one.  He was going to continue on to the park visitor center while we finished up.  We made one more stop along the way to look for PE0302 (B 145) and we think we found the proper rock garden.  We'll go back to check it out more thoroughly.  We met up with my father and went to Sand Beach and then did the Great Head loop.  Squirrels following us all the way and I even fonud another little frog like the one I almost ran over on my bike on Sunday.  Did a small auto tour, showing him Monument Cove and then back to town for supper.  Rosalie's for pizza and lots of beer!  Then walked around town a bit, R bought Keen sandals for hiking and I got a pink grapefruit gelato. Butterfield's is gone!  We couldn't believe it.
