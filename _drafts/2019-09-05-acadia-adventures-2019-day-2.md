We woke up at 6am after a typical mildly-uncomfortable night in the car under our fleece moose-motif blanket. It really helped that I was wearing Rs headband over my face as an eye mask, even though we were able to get our favorite dark corner parking spot that we were unable to get the past few years. There are still always a few lights hitting us in the face in certain positions. I will have to remember to bring the headbands again for us next year. I know it took a while to fall asleep but I slept quite well through the night. I recall dreaming about a change made to a work policy - we could either get a yearly raise or opt instead to hug a sloth. I was trying to work out how much it would cost to hug a sloth at a zoo and see if I could do it more than once if i took the raise, or if just hugging the sloth at work would be the better deal Yes I think I was still tired (and dehydrated!).

After a quick breakfast of cheesecake from Rein's, we were soon on the road and heading for our traditional first stop at LL Bean, where we arrived by 7:30am. There wasn't anything in particular that I wanted (although I ended up with a pair of hiking pants) but Rich wanted to see if he could get an exchange for a rain shell he had only worn a few times and the lining had begun to wear off. The registers were down for a a little while but eventually they came back online and the manager was able to find and refund (in the form of a gift card) the purchase price. they still make something similar so R decided he would try it again. Very cool that when we brought it back to the register the actually did a full exchange, giving us credit for the entire new jacket which had gone up in price by $20.

Back on the insane highway for about 30 miles took us to Augusta where we finally got a break on Route 3. We headed toward our lunch stop, Young's Lobster Pound in Belfast, windingaround and up and down behind logging trucks until we finally got to the lobster pier. It was ealy for lunch and there was only one other couple there at the tieme, so our lobster rolls came out quickly and we ate on the very windy pier. (Reminder next ime to get them to go and then go to Moose Point for a picnic!) 

Searsport along the way was the site of a benchmark find last year, and it was this year as well. This one was on a monument that I was pretty sure I had been able to see from the satellite view, so I expected it to be pretty obvious. When we got to the site along Steamboat Road, though, I had second thoughts. The entire area was overgrown with five foot tall weeds and wildflowers. Asteraceae and Rosaceae galore! And probaly ticks too. But I dove in and was able to find the monument and the mark. Taking a photo was a challenging task but I think ti eventually worked out. Some of the flowers here were really beautiful including some bright pink variety that I have never seen at home.

We made a quick stop at the renovated visitors center on our way into town and then arrived to check in around 1pm. We were told we couldn't check in util 3, news to us! We were so looking forward to a nap and shower before pizza. The woman took our phone number and said she would call if the room was ready earlier. We were only about half a block down the street when she called 45 seconds later. (:Did you go far?" "Oh yeah, we just got to Bass Harbor!" we should have told her. We took an Uber copter!) Anyway, we were able to check in immediately and get that nap and shower.


Supper as usual was the pizza we've been waiting all year for, our medium plain pizza at Rosalie's. A few things were different, though. We were there only a few minutes after they opened at 4:00, yet te entire downstairs was already full. We have in the past always been able to get a first floor booth on our first night. They were also out of our usual brew, the Shipyard export ale. So we got a Baxter Stowaway IPA instead, which was also great (I mean it's an IPA so it's guaranteed I would like it). At a second floor table we were able to look down on the busy street and we could see the Rosalie's sign through the window, a view we've certainly never had before. We had the entire floor to ourselves for a while before two other groups showed up Fortuantely they were quiet and we were able to eat in peace. After devouring the pizza and beer  in the warm glow of good food and drink and with the promise of beautiful interesting days ahead, we looked over the map for a few minutes and decide that we would take some time tomorrow to search for the remaining carved crosses on Cadillac Mountain. At least maybe we can get a start on them. Saturday's forecast doesn't look good (at least not good enough to be roaming around the summit) and it and Sunday are weekend days likely to be busier than Friday.

We checked out the new restaurant in Morning Glory's building, royal Indian. Food was brought out to some people sitting on the porch as we went by and it smelled amazing! We asked what it was. They weren't even sure but a man working there confirmed that it was chicken tikka. The restaurant patrons said it was great and that the dumplings were good too. We may have to try it. 

Then we spent a few minutes in Cadillac Mountain Sports and Rock and Art Shop (which was closing at 6 so we barely had achance to look at anything, but we di see some beautiful air plants and rhipsalis that we'll have to take a closer look at another evening. The giraffe taxidermy was astounding!

We made our way to MDI Ice Cream to see if by chance they had blueberry basil sorbet. They did, so I had to get it - but they also had many other flavrs that sounded so good. I would also have liked to try the 5 spice ice cream and pineapple pimenton sorbet. I already know te sour cherry sorbet and cinnamon cardamom ice cream are great. R had cranberry bliss, which was also extremely good. It was vanila ice cream with dried cranberries and orange but there was some other flavor in there too that we couldn't identify but it was a perfect complement to the other fruity flavors. We would both get it again. A quick trip to Hannaford for drinks (we were SO thirsty after not having much to drink all day) rounded out the evening. We got blueberry lemonade, blueberry ale, water, and bananas (and enormos paper towels).
