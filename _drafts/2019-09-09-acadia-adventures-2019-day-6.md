Mount Dessert bakery for bagels (plain and cheese with veggie cream cheese), sticky bun (I think they have Morning Glory's recipe).

Archbold estate with remnants of fountains, winding driveway, BArberry ledge with so many boundary markers, then old route into the park up to Duck Brook Rd (have to look into this). 

Stone marker #1 - 370 - 375
#2 - 376-382
#3 - 383-390
#4 - 391-394
#5 - 403-406

Spontaneous trip to Asticou for popovers, lobster ceviche and lobster/crab cakes.
