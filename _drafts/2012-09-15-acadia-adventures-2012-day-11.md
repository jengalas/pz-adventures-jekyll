Breakfast? Was it Two Cats? Searched for two BMs (P 145 and Q 145). Hike at Beech Mountain with Dave and family. Stopped at farm stand afterward and bought raw honey.  Drove to SWH in the rain and did B 145 after buying cheeses (Lamb Chopper, Chevrotin, and Raschera). Supper was pizza at Rosalie's.
