Awesome, incredible day! Ditched our original plans to go to the ruins (Keet Seel) and instead decided to head north to Utah. Remember looking for BMs at Goosenecks and Muley Point (and the crappy road to get to M.P. [5-mile gravel/sand road off Rt. 261]), looking up at Cedar Mesa in pure awe and wondering how in the hell the "dugway" would take us over it-remember looking at that road in the GPSr!  Saw it on the map and were immediately intrigued because it looked so crazy and was brown on the Indian map, meaning it wasn't paved.  We know what those "highways" are like!  A Native woman in the Mexican Hat (also checked out Mexican Hat formation!) general store said we could get up it without a problem, but we still had our doubts (again, we know what the "highways" are like in this area!). Met Dutch couple on 3-week vacation at Natural Bridges (Bear's Ear!) where we checked out Horsecollar Ruin and hiked down to Sipapu Bridge.  The trail was full of ladders and neat dropoffs as we worked or way down to the stream at the bottom.  What a sight to look up from underneath the bridge!  The Dutch couple continued on to try to do the entire loop hike to see all three bridges, but we turned around and drove the rest of the loop road instead.
