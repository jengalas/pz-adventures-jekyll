This morning Rich and I finally had a good opportunity to stop at the Montessori school near the Ragged Edge to look for a benchmark. We've been looking forward to the search for this benchmark since we began planning our trip. According to the datasheet, it is (or was, in 1966) `ON THE GROUNDS OF A LARGE MUSEUM, SET IN THE TOP OF THE NORTH CORNER OF CONCRETE BASE WHICH SUPPORTS A LARGE ANCHOR`.

We thought this sounded really cool! It was clear that the building was no longer a museum, but it wasn't until we arrived on Monday that we realized it is now a school.

We were assisted by a woman who works at the school and was just arriving early in the morning. She led us right to the base where the anchor had been set, explaining that she believed the anchor itself was now at the History of Diving Museum just down the road at MM 83. (When we drove by the museum later in the morning, we noticed a rusty anchor—as it had been described in one of the recoveries—positioned outside.) 

We assumed the woman who helped us was a teacher, and had to laugh at her very teacher-like response to Rich's question about where the anchor is now: "Wow, that's a **_really_** good question!"

For breakfast we visited Bob's Bunz again, where today I chose the Blue Crab Eggs Benedict with home fries, and Rich had two eggs, bacon and pancakes. We got two "mini stickies" to go, just to have as a snack later in the day. Everything was great, especially the crabcakes in the Eggs Benedict. They were full of crabmeat and full of flavor!

Our next stop was the Pigeon Key Visitors Center. I hadn't heard much about Pigeon Key until last night, when I was idly researching interesting things to see and do in the area. Actually, the only thing I knew (from old topo maps and benchmark descriptions) was that the old Overseas Highway originally passed over Pigeon Key.

There were a few benchmarks on Pigeon Key, too, so it had already earned a spot on the list of places we might want to visit. But a quick search last night showed me that there was apparently a lot more going on at Pigeon Key than I knew! It turned out to be one of the neatest, most interesting and exciting days of our trip. 

The Pigeon Key Visitors Center is set up in an old Pullman car on Knight Key. We arrived there at 9:40am, thinking that as long as it wasn't already full we would be just in time to catch the 10:00am ferry. And we were. We added our names to the list, paid our $12 each, and then browsed the gift shop while waiting for our tour guide to appear.

In the meantime, we located and purchased the 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle of the Florida East Coast Railway that we had seen mentioned in a TripAdvisor review. The shop also offered a great selection of books about the railway and Henry Flagler, although we didn't have time to browse through them and probably won't have room in our suitcases to bring them back with us.  We still intend to purchase at least a few of them when we get home.

Captain Billy took our small group of 12 (plus guide) over to the island, across the beautifully clear blue water of the channel.  It was a very pleasant 10-15 minute ride.

Once on Pigeon Key, we were treated to a great tour by a woman named Riet. The group sat in a circle beneath the old railway while we listened to a detailed overview of Flagler's life and the building of the railway, work camp on the island, and later maintenance camps. Riet was full of interesting anecdotes and pointed out most of the interesting plants on the island too, like gumbo-limbo (supposedly an antidote to poisonwood), saw palmetto, Christmas palm, and signature/autograph tree. Riet's presentation was thorough and animated, and she was able to answer everyone's questions with ease. We found the "Negro bunkhouse" mentioned in the description of the tri-station **MOSER RESET**. The building is now labeled "Commissary" but it has served several different purposes over time, including post office and maid's house.

We also met the island cat, Buddy, who followed the group around until he got bored, plopped down, and resumed licking his rear end. The museum was fascinating and well cared for, and we could have spent the entire afternoon there! Not only was there great information about Flagler and those who worked on the island (foremen, engineers, and workers, and their families), but also artifacts like bottles found on the island, engineering plans for the bridge and railway, and beautiful models of the bridge building process. It was truly an amazing amount of well-curated material in a small space. Before leaving we watched the video, a brief film about Flagler's life detailing his friendship and working relationship with J.D. Rockefeller, his family life and incredible ambition for the building of the railway and resorts—really opening up the wilderness of Florida for the first time—very late in his life.

We then decided to search for a few benchmarks that we had prepared for at home. After thanking and tipping Riet and letting her know that we would be walking back to Knight Key on the bridge rather than taking the boat, we began to look for MOSER, MOSER's reference marks, and C 17. (See benchmark recoveries below for details.) We enjoyed walking around the old swimming pool/fish pond/shark pool. 

Walking back on the bridge was a real treat! It was hot and windy but such gorgeous views. We saw many rays in the water, and kept an eye out for BMs along the bridge even though we hadn't planned for any. One was right across from the ramp up from Pigeon Key! 

Once we reached the east end of the bridge ("What's that I smell? I keep smelling burgers?! Oh.") we talked with the guy running the signup stand for Friends of Old Seven—from where the delicious burger aroma was emanating. He pointed out the survey markers on the eastern abutment after we mentioned that we were looking for them. I always appreciate it when people have taken notice of their surroundings and are aware of benchmarks before we tell them! We recovered all three marks—one of which, KNIGHT 2, was in a rather precarious spot—without any problems.

We were reluctant to leave, so we poked around for a few more minutes on the north side of the bridge in case there were any other marks to be found. (There weren't.) We walked back underneath the bridge to the visitors center to retrieve the car.

By this time, as you can imagine after a full morning's worth of activities in the hot Florida sun, we were starving. We couldn't wait to try the sandwiches at a fish market/cafe called Brutus in Marathon. The five-star TripAdvisor reviews were accurate.  Brutus was fabulous! Every single item we ordered, from the real brewed iced tea (unsweetened) to the coleslaw, black bean salad, and hand-cut homemade fries were awesome and made with obvious care and high quality ingredients. Our sandwiches were the Deluxe Fish Sandwich (which today was grilled grouper with artichoke, tomato, and garlic/cilantro sauce on multigrain bread) and fried conch with tomato, lettuce, onion and chipotle sauce on a bun—both sublimely delicious! We'd go back without a second thought. (Actually, Rich said, if we had the money we'd fly down sometime from home, just for lunch!)

Our afternoon adventure took place at Curry Hammock State Park, the main section of which consists mostly of beach and campgrounds, and water, of course. It's apparently a popular area for parasailing, and we hoped to see some action, but everyone was done for the day. 

Where was the nature trail we had read about? It's actually back southwest along the highway a bit, and on the other side of the road from the main section of the park. We located the parking area and then had to search a bit for the trailhead, which is a few hundred yards east along the Heritage Trail. This jungle-like trail is a real hidden gem! We had more fun there than I ever expected. The deep shade under dense stands of native Florida thatch palms provided a welcome respite from the hot sun—and the spooky environment was a plus. Around each bend we expected we might encounter an elf, or a troll ... or perhaps a hatchet-wielding weirdo. We encountered none of those, but our imaginations were entertained. And like any nature trail, the walk was educational, too. We learned about poisonwood trees (watch what you're leaning up against!), how the area gained its soil (carried on the Trade Winds from the Sahara Desert!), the plants' resilience in major storms and wind, and about solution holes in coral that capture fresh water for use by various organisms. And the best was to come at the end of the trail: we found a surprise hydrographic station, REED, at the Florida Bay Overlook! On our return hike, we found three hermit crabs dwelling in a large solution hole.

Tonight's light supper was a small pizza and Yuengling at New Jersey Boardwalk Pizza, which was actually very tasty despite my preconception that pizza in Florida is probably not very good. (I've been spoiled by PA, NJ, and NY pizza—what can I say?) We had just enough for a snack, and enjoyed every bite.
