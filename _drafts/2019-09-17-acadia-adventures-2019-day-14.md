Breakfast: croissant for R, cheese bagel with veggie cream cheese for me, from Mount Dessert. Coffee and Darjeeling. We also got two blueberry hand pies for the road.

Got an early start, left at 8:50. Not too bad, actually able to avoid most of the craziness through MA and CT. Stopped around 12:45 in Portsmouth for lunch at Lexies. Fish tacos and fish sandwich, iced tea. Stopped at Quinn's on the way home. Back just before 8:00.
