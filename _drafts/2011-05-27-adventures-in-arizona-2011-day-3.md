Still on eastern time, we got up at 5:30 and decided to head right out instead of eating first.  We just grabbed a jelly donut from the lobby and then went to SNP-east. We spotted POST Tri station on the map and actually found it, and expected that there were RMs but couldn't find them. We later found out that there are RMs and got the datasheet, hoping we would be able to return another day to look for them.

We hiked up the Tanque Verde Ridge trail, got up past 4700 ft elevation and hiked more than 2.5 miles.  Again it was very hot and there was a lot of climbing but with the breeze the conditions were extremely comfortable. Along the way we saw many different species of cactus, then yucca and grasses as we got higher.
