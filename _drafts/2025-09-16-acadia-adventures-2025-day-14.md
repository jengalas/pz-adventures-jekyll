This morning when we went to the lobby for breakfast, we finally ran into Christopher. We were anxious to ask him our two questions from Sunday and yesterday: can we access the causeway, and what is happening at the site of Rogue Cafe?

He didn't know the answer to either one, but he texted a friend who is a member at the Causeway Club. She replied that yes, it is fine to visit the causeway, but you can no longer park down near the tennis courts. We would have to park in the lot for the golf course and walk down (which is fine).

Christopher's take on what was happening at Rogue was similar to Rich's: probably converting it into a takeout place (maybe because of the campground nearby?) but he said the owner is kinda crazy, so it's anyone's guess. He also asked his friend if she had any idea about it.

His friend texted back soon enough: "Don't know, she's nuts."

So I guess we'll just have to wait until next year to see what, if anything, develops!

I had no idea what to expect for today, but as we ate our oatmeal ("wallpaper paste," as Christopher called it), on the porch, Rich suggested checking out the Beech Mountain area to investigate what I thought I had seen last year: a trail leading off to the northwest from one of the points of the switchbacks on the Valley Trail.

This sounded great to me, even though I was still a bit sore from yesterday's run. I always feel better when I move around anyway, and the fact that he was feeling up to the hike was more than enough to get me on board.

I also checked my "Abandoned Acadia" app/map and noticed that there was a point of interest very close by, a CCC fish rearing pool near the south end of Long Pond, that could also be fun to check out. And we already knew that we wanted to stop at the Beech Hill Farm.

Because the point we wanted to reach on Lurvey Spring Road was much closer to the Long Pond Road end, we decided just to come in that way - Seal Cove Road to Long Pond Road, turn onto Lurvey Spring and park at the entrance to the shortcut trail. I found this trail last year and figured it would be an easy and relatively quick way to access the point on the switchback that I wanted to check out. I was also looking forward to showing Rich the shortcut trail.

fortunately the trail was still easy walking the whole way, without much overgrowth, and the trail is relatively level, with just a gentle steady climb up to where it meets the Valley Trail (in no more than about a tenth of a mile). We popped out on the trail and continued to hike up to the next switchback, slowly, because there are some giant rock steps in this area. 

As we emerged onto the open ledge right at the switchback, the views opened up. This is a great spot which is why it tends to attract and collect a lot of people who hang around for the view and the rest after climbing or descending all those steps. We took a few quick photos and then I started to follow the trail I thought I'd seen. I didn't really want anyone following me, so I disappeared quickly into the woods.

I was really hoping that the trail would lead to the ledges overlooking Long Pond that are visible on the satellite view. But unfortunately after a few hundred feet, the trail such as it was petered out. I looked around for any sign of passage to the north, but it was just blueberry bushes, pine needle carpet, boulders, and steep dropoffs. Nothing. 

It looked like it would be easier to head upwards through the relatively open woods than to make my way back as I'd come in, so I did that. After a few minutes I emerged onto the South Ridge Trail, where I ran into a couple we'd passed down below when we were climbing the Valley Trail.

"Looks like you lost your hiking partner!" the woman said. "He's down there," I gestured. "I just wanted to look for something interesting in the woods." "Did you find it?" "Nope, it wasn't anything!"

And it wasn't. But that's OK. At least my curiosity was satisfied, and we got a good hike out of it. I joined Rich (who was a little surprised to see me coming back the opposite way on the Valley Trail) and we retraced our steps back down to the shortcut trail and then back to the car.

I was really curious about the fish rearing pool. These structures and their associated operation and maintenance were apparently part of the CCC's mission, although I had never heard about this until this morning when I started researching the fish pool (coordinates for which I'd gotten from [a post](https://acadiamemorials.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-civilian-conservation-corps-at.html) on Don Lenahan's _Memorials of Acadia National Park_ website). 

Parking at Long Pond was tight today, and we ended up pulling over on the west shoulder of the road, within a few hundred feet of the coordinates. "Look," Rich said. "There's an old road in there." And there was, an old road branching off Long Pond Road with no gates or signs, but also no indication that anyone drives in there althouhg it was plenty wide enough to do so.

We cut through the woods and followed the old road through a clearing (where we noted some stonework "put there by man") lining the edge of the road and also in a vague ellipse, outlining a patch of trees. We soon saw the elaborate stonework of the fish rearing pool and walked over to investigate. It was really quite impressive! I crossed to the other side on a wooden plank, and the view up the chute of the pool/creek is really beautiful. We poked around in the area for more than thirty minutes, even wondering if some of the stonework we saw were abutments or retaining walls for a bridge crossing the creek, indicating that the road had crossed at one point. (We're still not sure about this. There does appear to be a road grade on the other side of the creek, but I followed it and it doesn't seem to go very far. Could just be covered by blowdowns, though - not something I wanted to try to pick my way through today. I'll investigate further on the old maps.)

And finally, we made our way to the Beech Hill Farm stand. We were greeted with literal stacks of pies when we first opened the door, and were really wishing we'd come here earlier in the trip so we could have had a pie to snack on all week. As it was, we knew we wouldn't be able to finish a whole pie before it was time to leave. But I made a note of it for next time.

The bakery case also featured cheddar scallion scones, orange cream cake, and cardamom pecan coffee cake, all of which sounded wonderful but that we really didn't need. We did, however, pick up an olive oil focaccia, some herbed goat cheese to go with it, some pecan shortbread cookies, and a few tins of the Chinese tea that I always buy here. They also had the biggest, most perfect-looking, incredble oyster mushrooms we've ever seen. Too bad we don't really have a way to saute them ... they would be so good.

As you might suspect, we ate the shortbread cookies on the ride back to the hotel, and then had half of the focaccia spread with half of the goat cheese for lunch. (We're saving the other half for breakfast.) We spent a relaxing afternoon reading and researching again, which is how I learned even more about the fish rearing pool and the CCC's work here in general.

Our original plan for supper was to try the new Mexican place in town, Salsa Verde Grill. We walked over there (hobbled, actually because we were both sore!) only to find the place dark, quiet, and locked up. I have no idea why, because every set of posted hours we saw indicated that they should be open on Tuesdays. But this evening they weren't. No sign or anything on the door.

So that narrowed down our options to the two other places we had briefly discussed: The Ovens and Paddy's. It was probably the Guinness that swayed Rich toward choosing Paddy's! And that was fine with me. 

Most people were sitting outside on this warm, perfectly blue-sky day. As usual, we chose to sit inside, and we got a nice table for two right by the window, and in a cozy little corner. I would love to sit there again.

Our server Ermen brought out our pints of Guinness right away, but it took us a while to decide on what to order. We weren't very hungry, more just snacky, so we didn't even consider an appetizer, and just chose a sandwich (pork banh mi) which was new to us, and fish tacos, which I've had before. Rich ordered fries without salt, which is what we prefer but usually forget to ask for. They were happy to oblige, just mentioned that it would take a little longer.

Everything ended up being very tasty and satisfying, and the atmosphere was relaxed and peaceful (again, because very few people were seated inside, and no one sat near us). The cole slaw had a heavy helping of horseradish included, which we really liked. I also like that it wasn't swimming in sauce. And the fish tacos featured the same very well executed fish that's in their fish & chips and Wexford fish sandwich (just smaller pieces). The pork banh mi was also surprisingly good, with a balanced mix of sweet and pickle flavors in the veggies, tender, thinly sliced pork, and served on a fresh, toasted ciabatta bun.

We were too full at the moment to order dessert, but we had already discussed stopping at MDI Ice Cream on our walk back to the room, as long as it was still warm. Funny enough, Ermen recommended it to us and told us it was his favorite ice cream place in town! (Rich started looking around for the cameras and microphones.)

As we were finishing up, a man walked by outside wearing a t-shirt that said "Dark Side of the Loon." Something struck me about that and I suggested that should be the name of whatever new establishment the woman who owns Rogue is building.

I think the Guinness cured me, at least temporarily, because my legs were pain-free and no longer stiff when we left the restaurant. Works for me! :grin:

Before ice cream, we had one other stop to make: Cadillac Mountain Sports for Rich to pick up one (or two, as it turned out) of the same hats I've been using for running. He really liked them and figured he could use some too. He bought two, in his "standard colors": forest green and tan.

And then, finally, we headed over to the ice cream shop for kid's scoops of maple pecan and Maine blueberry ice cream, which we ate on a bench in the village green, as usual. Perfect ending to a relaxing day!
