Got up and went to Cafe This Way.  Blueberry pancakes and Earl Grey; plain pancakes, bacon, corned beef hash.  Javelina behind me inhaled Kit's Burrito, asked about coffee and didn't leave a tip.  Hike: parked at Jordan Pond House, took Spring Trail (confusion over trail names), to Jordan Cliffs Trail, to East Face Trail, to Penobscot Summit where our sunny day turned cloudy and then the mist rolled in in a matter of seconds.

Stopped at Visitor Center to make reservations for ranger program (Gulliver Moose in Lilliput), stopped at ferry terminal to check for BARH A BM but couldn't get close enough to see it.  Skipped mark at Bluenose Inn because I was too cold and had to pee.  Maggie's for supper: onion bread, small salad, beef balls with peanut coconut curry sauce; lobster crepes with brandy cream sauce, squash with coconut milk, rice (R).  Lamb rack with red wine and rosemary sauce.  Upside down pear ginger cake with whipped cream for dessert.  Stopped at Mighty H for water, beer and juice.
