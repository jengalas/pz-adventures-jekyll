All last night I was craving something made with wild Maine blueberries: blueberry pie, or the blueberry crepes from Sunrise Cafe. Rich wasn't too hungry this morning (and honestly neither was I, but I was still craving blueberries). We decided to give it a try anyway.

The cafe was busy when we arrived around 7:40am, but we grabbed one of the small tables and waited for our order. I had the blueberry crepes as planned, and Rich got the turkey crepe, which is stuffed with cheese (gruyere?), arugula, creamy sauce, and avocado and comes with a small salad on the side with a tasty mustard vinaigrette.

We were halfway through our crepes when two guys came in and sat at the table next to us. One guy was wearing a t-shirt that said "Got venom?" on the front. As they were dressed in motorcycle attire, I assumed it was probably something to do with a motorcycle club. But then I noticed the logo on the back of his shirt: Florida Snakebite Institute. 

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery1" class="" %}

I took a stealth photo at first, but then Rich came right out and asked him if he was into snakes! He said that yes, he doesn't work with them professionally but as a hobby, and has even bred timber rattlesnakes in the past. We talked a bit about snake advocacy and how we can't understand the desire to kill them, whether on the trail or in a roundup (Texas-style, where they actually kill them as opposed to the Pennsylvania one where they just capture, measure, and release). Rich mentioned our garter snakes living in the wall, and the man immediately commented on how he has seen them poking their heads out inquisitively, and how cute they are. So cool to meet another snake person!

And the day got a bit snakier, but you'll have to wait for that.

Our hike for today was going to be at the Kittredge Brook Preserve, where I hiked last year. I really enjoyed it and have wanted to take Rich there all the while. This year's conditions are so different, though. It has apparently been very dry here in Maine, and so much of the lush moss and lichen from last year are stiff, dull, and dried up. Not complaining, though! It makes for much easier hiking, and not having to worry at all about the weather forecast has been a very unusual treat. It was also a treat that we saw no one else on these trails until the very end. 

We did the main loop like I did last year, and walked the northern trail (Long Heath?) just until the point where its loop began. It appeared to be in much better condition than last year, when it was technically closed, and I had a very hard time navigating over and around hundreds of blown-down trees and swampy ground, and even lost the trail a few times. Then we walked north just a bit from the point where the loopback on the main trail began. This too was much drier than last year. Rich just wanted to get a sense of what it was like, so we can come back another time, perhaps on a misty morning when conditions will be better for photography.

We turned around and headed back on the western side of the main loop. At some point I mentioned that we hadn't seen any (living) snakes yet this trip, and how last year it took until the last day for me to find one. And that was only after doing the snake call. Well, I did the snake call right after that, and less than five minutes later, what was at my feet on the trail but a beautiful small maritime garter snake!!!

He was too quick for me, and I didn't have a chance to turn the camera on and point it at him before he slithered off the trail and over a small birch log, and slipped down into the leaves beneath a rock. We waited for a few minutes but he never came back out. I was still so thrilled by the sighting!

A few minutes down the trail, a frog crossed our path; well, hopped right across, bounced off the moss and landed in an eroded ditch. Then he hopped right back up again. That was amusing. He was well hidden and very well camouflaged, but I managed to take a few photos while he rested there.

We quickly came to the end of the loop. On our way back to the car, we were curious about this other trail that branches off just before you reach the official preserve trails. It is marked by a rather large and very obvious blue arrow, and was confusing to me the first time because I wondered if it was part of the official trails. But I didn't follow it last time, and today we decided to walk down it just a bit. We would like to go back and check it out in full sometime soon. I just can't imagine where it goes, other than possibly to someone's neighborhood. But it doesn't make sense to me why anyone would basically be "advertising" their own private trail in that misleading way on a public preserve. If I had my own way in, I certainly wouldn't want to lead people astray right to my own back yard.

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery3" class="" %}

While we were there, photographing a few leaves and plants, a woman came by and asked if we were photographing plants or animals. If we were watching an animal she didn't want to walk by and disturb it, which was very considerate. Just plants, though, so she passed right on by, down the mystery trail. I didn't think until later that I should have asked her where it went. Oh well, another mystery we will get to solve ourselves!

Kittredge Brook Preserve actually has a second disjointed section just to the north, off Norway Drive and then Bluffs Road. Supposedly it is just a short trail to a cascade, which would likely have no water in it this year, but we still wanted to investigate the trail.

There is no signage regarding the preserve on the way into this development. You basically have to know where you're going. Once you get to the parking area, there is a small sign with the same Kittredge Brook Preserve map that we saw in the other section.

The trail looked pretty overgrown from the beginning, so I took a quick run down to check out the conditions. I didn't get more than 100 yards in before I came to a huge deadfall right across the bogwalks, so massive and destructive that it has actually completely upended one section of bogwalk. And what I could see in the distance didn't look much better. We'll have to try this another time if some trail maintenance is done.

There was potentially enough time left for one more quick activity this afternoon, and I suggested looking for the Fandango puzzle solution spot on the cliff above Hunters Beach. You may remember last year, when we attempted to reach this spot from the beach, and had a good laugh when we realized we couldn't even cross the roaring brook let alone attempt to climb the tree-covered nearly vertical cliff on the other side.

Well, today we decided to attempt to reach the location from the Park Loop Road. There is a convenient, very long parking pulloff right before the place where we would need to enter the woods. We had about 350 feet to walk up the road before reaching the point where we would turn into the woods, and almost right up until that point, there was a very steep dropoff just about three feet in from the road. We kept going, though, and fortunately right at the point where we would have to turn into the woods, the terrain leveled out and it looked doable! I was getting pretty excited.

There was some poky deadfall to step over, but once we got into the woods it was relatively easy walking and not even very steep. We worked our way almost straight toward the coordinates, and looked around for just a minute before Rich spotted the two boulders we were seeking. The spot was pretty obvious, because there was a small rock placed between the two boulders, wrapped with bright orange flagging tape. Behind the rock, we spotted a small watertight container - very similar to a geocache!

I'm not sure if this is what was originally left here. The published solution says:

> Per a reader’s suggestion, I have placed a  ‘visible’ painted ‘souvenir’ stone with key near the spot.

We didn't find a painted souvenir stone, but we did find the container with a pretty box inside, a handful of foreign coins, and several beaded bracelets. And - two small silver keys! So we don't know if these had anything to do with the original "souvenir stone" that the author referred to, but it's obvious that whatever this was, it had something to do with the puzzle solution location.

Rich noticed a faint path passing by the boulders, so I followed it to map it out and see where it went. And wouldn't you believe it ... it went right down to the beach. So it's possible that if we had been able to cross the brook last year (which is nearly dried up this year, by the way, since it has been so dry) we may have also found this path and been able to reach the boulders last year. But in any case, we found the spot today and it was a lovely little diversion for the afternoon. And it helped us work up an appetite!

We missed Red Sky very much last year, when for some reason we just didn't make it there for dinner. (Most likely because there was just too much good food right in town, and most nights we didn't want a big meal!) Tonight, it was perfect. We arrived just a few minutes early for our 5:00pm reservation, and checked out the menu while we waited, basically making our choices at that time. 

We typically are assigned one of the small tables for two, but this time we got one of the larger tables where one side is a padded, booth-like seat. Very nice and much more roomy than the typical smaller tables. They have these interesting tap lights on a stand (not sure how to described them) that cycle between a cool and a warm light. That was nice because although they obviously wanted the warm light on for the ambiance, we were able to switch to the cool light when we were taking our food photos. 

Usually beer is our beverage of choice here, but tonight we opted for cocktails: Empress gin & tonic for me and Kentucky Monk for Rich. That was a delicious bourbon-based cocktail that seemed to get stronger as the evening went on! And of course the Empress gin was beautiful and delicious.

We enjoyed the white bean dip and toasts that came out just before the bread, which was delicious as always. Then our appetizers came out, and they were spectacular. The smoked salmon was a perfect little piece, and so tasty with the goat cheese and cream cheese spread, capers, and red onions on their house-made sesame crackers. We've never tried the polenta topped with mushrooms before, but my father always liked it. It too was delicious, crispy-chewy with a topping of shiitake and crimini mushrooms and the green of the day: chard. I don't know if I've ever had chard before, but it has such a distinctive flavor ... somewhat cabbagy, musty/earthy. I just loved it.

And that's a good thing, because our pasta dish, the house-made tagliatelle, also came topped with chard! The pasta noodles (or noodle, since Rich is convinced it was just one v-e-r-y l-o-n-g noodle folded over itself a hundred times in the bowl) were perfectly tender, and the mix of the pasta, greens, cherry tomatoes, ricotta and pepper was perfectly balanced. Loved every bite of that too!

We had just the smallest amount of room left for a light dessert, and Rich chose the bittersweet Belgian chocolate pudding for us to share. It came topped with a dollop of whipped cream and a pistachio tuile on the side. It had just the right level of sweetness that we were looking for, and wasn't nearly as rich as I'd feared. Again, a perfect ending to a perfect meal (and day)!
