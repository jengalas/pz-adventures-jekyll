It's Saturday and we woke up to the "low clouds" (fog and drizzle) that had been promised all week. Not that that's typically our favorite kind of conditions, but we like them for a day devoted to photography, and we had hoped today would work out well for that. The fog was extremely thick this morning, and humid with every breath. First we've seen it like this in a few years, at least.

First order of the day is always to obtain something to eat! The Flowered Apron bakery would be opening at 8am, we knew, so we headed over there and were a bit early, because the early bird gets the worm (or the lemon squares). Karen and her husband were buzzing around, getting everything ready. Rich took a few photos while Karen sent her husband down to the corner to set up the bike witht he sign on it. She then invited us in to check out he goodies! Everything looked great, but we got the lemon-blueberry cake and lemon squares as planned, and also a molasses-ginger cookie. Had to pass on the brownies and apple-walnut cake, but if we were going to be here next weekend I'm sure we would try something different.

They are not serving coffee or tea at the bakery this year, so we stopped at Slice of Eden on ur way back to the room to get some. The line was SO long and it took at least 20 minutes but R eventually emerged, and we got our drinks and the breakfast sandwich he had ordered a few minutes later. While I waited I had the "pleasure" of listening to southern Beavis and Butthead complain about red, white and blue something on "Jap" cars like Toyota, and chortle about this and that. Not sure why they were here rather than at some Nascar rally or whatever. 

During our leisurely breakfast on the porch, we decided that we would do a route similar to one we had done last year, parking at the Visitor Center and walking down to Breakneck Road, following it south (and lookin for the road heading up toward Lake Wood/Fawn Pond while we were there), and the coming through the connector trail up onto the carriage road near Witch Hole. That's what we did! I have never seen so many amazing mushrooms as we saw today along BReakneck Road. So many different shapes and kinds and colors, it took us hours to walk that short stretch of road, loving every minute (even when our feet and legs fell asleep from bending down and sitting on them so much)! 

We did not see many critters today, other than a few chipmunks and a lot of fat slugs (from all those mushrooms, I guess)! There is a huge rockslide along Breakneck Road the likes of which we've never seen before. There is a nice path worn through it by local walkers, so we had no trouble making our way through this newly-appeared boulder field.

We took the shortcut trail that was new to me (but Rich had ridden it years ago) between Breakneck Road and the carriage roads,and came back to the visitors center via the carriage roads. We didn't see too mcuh ehre other than some more mushrooms, a woman who had lost her husband "he's wearing a bright orange Acadia t-shirt!" (adn found humid again soon after), lots of cyclists, and no snakes. :(

As I told Dad, I'm almost embarrassed to admit what we had for supper tonight. Yes, we did takeout of Epi's pizza! It wasn't bad, althugh it doesn't come close to Rosalie's in flavor or texture. I will say that everyone there was extremely friendly and the service was prompt. I called in the order, Rich drove us downtown and dropped me off, and I picked up the pizza which was ready within a few minutes and then walked over to where he had parked on Rodick Street. It worked out well, and we had beer and pizza back on our porch (and split a lemon square for dessert).
