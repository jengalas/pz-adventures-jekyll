Breakfast: pastries from Morning Glory on the seawall (the gazebo was already occupied).  Sticky bun and apricot scone-like pastry, coffee and Earl Grey tea.  They didn't have the artichoke pockets or I would have gotten one for the trail! Leisurely morning, then Eliot Mountain hike from Thuya Gardens. Checked on the tri-station (need to compare to previous photos), "forest bagels," awesome natural moss "gardens", some confusion getting back on the correct trail after the Map House because of roads being cut in in the private section, Northern Ringneck Snake as we were leaving (just as we passed through the gate).  Saw (and heard) hummingbirds and many butterflies, sedum (which I was looking for everywhere!), tubular roses.  We stepped briefly into Thuya Lodge and noticed the new edition of "Mr Rockefeller's Roads", which we picked up later in the evening at Sherman's.  Remember the red squirrels that were out to get us!  (This was a theme for all of our hikes!)

Dinner: Side Street Cafe, lobster roll and pub fries, blueberry ale; lobster mac & cheese with Allagash white.  Pink lemonade pie, which was like key lime pie but lemon flavored, served with strawberries.  Wandered around town, looked for a cheap t-shirt for R and checked out the tea shop (or half of it).
