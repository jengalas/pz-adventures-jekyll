GOAT TRAIL!!!  Jeannie's for breafast (found out about her other endeavor, Sea Biscuits in SW Harbor). Had blueberry pancakes and egg sandwich.  Then took the bus to parking pull off just south of bubble Rock parking to look for the Goat Trail!  We decided to go down to the shore trail to look for the orange flagging tape that Tom mentioned the other day.  we fond it easily south of where we had been looking before (although this time we initially found what seemed to be another trail, that we later discovered might have been the original route of that end of the Jordan Pond Carry trail).  We found the flagging easily and actually, the entire route was flagged!  Much more than the two that Tom had mentioned.  It's so wild. This entire part of the Goat Trail is basically one long stone staircase heading up to the Park Loop road and it's almost impossible not to see it (I guess as long as you know it's there).  This is why Tom wants to call his book "Hidden in  Plain Sight." Part of the problem might be that we typicall hike the shore trail east to west and the trail is much easier to notice coming in th eother direction, but still.  It's there plain for all to see, and now even more easily since it's so obviously flagged (which may or may not be a good thing).  Tom first noticed the flagging on Friday and we didn't see it on Wednesday, so it would be interesting to see how long it lasts.  Wouldn't be surprised if the park service removes it.  Anyway we followed it to the top and used the very obvious handrail to pull ourselves up the last steepest part to the park loop road!  Totally awesome.  And directly across we saw where a whole series of rungs had been set in on a diagonal on the cliff face.  the rungs all but two of them (that we found so far) have been sawed off to discourage people from climbing up, but again, they are so obvious when you know where to look.  We decided to leave the second part of the trail for next year, when we can begin at the loop road and climb to the summit of Pemetic, and then take the opposite route down that we took heading up the mountain this year.

Counted coping stones on the way back, and we got 164 counting the one with the handrail and going to the last one in line wth the road at the pulloff.  Found two "Vista Management Program" markers along the way, whatever that is. Then we walked back down and took the shore trail to Jordan Pond House for black bean soup and POPOVERS yet again!!!

We weren't ready to go, so we took another short hike up the Spring Trail, noticing many red squirrels and their "lunch tables". Then back down the carriage roads.  Beatiful views and mosses all the way, and the drizzly weather was beginning to clear up. 

Took the bus back, noticed cute brown shih tzu named Gizmo.  Finally, a quiet well behaved dog! 

Quick trip to Jack Russell's to get Tom's email address and tell him that we found the Goat Trail.  He was on the phone so we didn't get to talk to him, but we did get the address.

Then went to Fathom for supper. Excellent as always.  Anadama bread to start as always, and blueberry and Real Ale.  Then lobster and red snapper spring roll, gnocchi with lobster, tomatoes, zucchini, and browned butter sauce, and halibut oscar.  Apple pie with vanilla ice cream for dessert.
