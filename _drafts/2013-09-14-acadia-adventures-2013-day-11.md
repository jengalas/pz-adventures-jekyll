Wheat bagel with spicy cilantro on the side, almond croissant

Norumbega Hike ([new] Goat Trail to Norumbega Mtn to Hadlock Ponds to trail back to parking). Remember great uphill on stairs similar to Perpendicular, althogh not as refined.  Sat at summit for a while to talk and relax, then looked for BROWN MTN again just to check on it.  Gorgeous trail back down, with so many types and colors of moss and lichens!

Jack Russell's for fish & chips and IPA and to talk to Tom.  Got lots of info about abandoned trails!  Remember to look for forthcoming new edition of walk in the park, reprint of trails of history and new abandoned trails book. At ngiht, met Dave and family for pizza at Rosalie's (where else?!)
