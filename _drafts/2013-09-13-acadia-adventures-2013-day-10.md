The 2nd M00siversary!  We awoke to rain, rain, rain.  Mom and dad were leaving this morning, so we took them to Cafe This Way for a hearty breakfast.  Mom and dad both had the french toast, which they agreed they could have shared.  I had the eggs benedict with smoked trout, and R had the oatmeal which he had been looking forward to all week, but was unfortunately not made the same way it had been in the past!  It looked like old fashioned oats that someone had poured hot water over.  He ended up eating some of my father's french toast. We then took a walk on the Shore Trail, in the opposite direction from how we usually do it. We began at Wayman Lane and worked our way back to the gazebo.  Mom and dad left soon afterward, and R and I were on our own.

The rest of the rainy day was spent poking around, visiting the Old School House and Museum (part of the MDI Historical Society) to see the exhibit "Shifting Gears: How the Automobile Transformed Life on MDI."  Small exhibit but very interesting and the posters were extremely well done.  THen we looked again for Q 145.  Still couldn't find the big boulder, even with the MDOT coordinates and our new thoughts on where the mark might be!  We found a probable location but only one outcrop that might possibly make sense, and it was completely covered with a layer of thick moss and pine debris.  Bummed, we decided to stop at the Atlantic Brewing Co. and Mainely Meat BBQ to check it out.  We had blueberry ale and leaf peeper red ale, and pulled pork sandwiches with cole slaw and potato salad and jalapeno cornbread.  Was a nice comforting meal on an extremely soggy, dreary day (but still a great day!)  While there I had the idea to contact Patriot Land Surveying, supposedly a local firm who have contributed NGS and MDOT recoveries, to ask if they knew where the hell Q 145 was.  We found an address for them using Google, but we drove up and down Highbrook Rd. without finding that number or anything that appeared to be a commercial building or business.  We did see one guy sitting by the road in a lawn chair smoking near the general vicinity of the address and later joked that that must be Patriot Land Surveying (who we later found out is Joe Coffey, and whom we called Joe (Pye Weed) Coffey for the rest of the trip, for reasons really unknown). On the way to supper, we checked out IRESON in the campground.  It was very busy and we didn't have the opportunity to actually search for the mark, but at least now we know what the area looks like.

Our moosiversary supper was at Town Hill Bistro.  We started with the cheese plate, which had two runny cheeses (my favorite, but unfortunately not R's), a cow and a goat. They had unusual accompaniments: homemade crackers (of course we had to ask for more), microgreens, dried cherries, apple slices, toasted hazelnuts, and a delicious ginger-pear chutney. Then for entrees we got sauteed cod with a lemon butter sauce (with green beans and hasselbeck potato) and gnocchi in asiago cream sauce with bacon and mushrooms.  Both were fantastic.  We had to have the lavender creme brulee for dessert of course!!!  And R told the waitress the story about last year's moose sighting.  It didn't work this time, unfortunately.  But we did get an anniversary candle.
