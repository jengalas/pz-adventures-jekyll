Had to eat at Matt's Big Breakfast.  Guy ate here: goofy troll head stencil-painted on wall.  Had honey-lemonade and shared an order of pancakes and bacon extra crispy. R had been craving pancakes with real maple syrup for weeks!

Flights were early, of course!  And believe it or not the only place we found silver charms (other than the Desert Garden), though we had searched for them the entire trip, was at a gift shop in the airport.
