Sea kayak adventure!!!  Met Brescian around 9:00am after a quick breakfast in the room.  Took time to get ready and learn how to paddle and learn safety procedures, then we were off. Headed straight for Sheep Porcupine, playing Frogger with tenders from cruise ship Eurodam (those dam ships, indeed!!!). Got there without any trouble, and saw a kingfisher and guillemots along the way.  Adventure of trying (and eventually succeeding) to find POR.  Such extremely difficult walking, like on ice!  Slipped on the way back, landed on kneecap but managed to get back OK.  Didn't have enough time left to go to BURNT but hopefully next time.  We paddled around Sheep and then around Bar Island before heading in.  We loved the experience and think we have a good feel for it now.  Would certainly want to do another kayak trip in the future, probably to find more marks!

We were totally beat, so supper was an early one at Rosalie's again (we just can't resist)!  This time it was a pizza with half pepperoni, and two large Shipyard ales, of course.  I think we were in bed by 6:55pm.
