> I'm writing this from the future: April 2, 2023. Last night, while watching an episode of "The Curse of Oak Island" that featured wide stone walls. Rich paused the video, turned to me, and asked "Wasn't there a hike we did where we were walking between these very wide, high stone walls?" I had had a similar vague memory, but didn't recall enough of it to even mention it. 
> 
> This simple question led to an evening of investigation into my notes, our photos and tracklogs, and eventally archived email messages. A message I had sent to the geocacher "Papadadio" in June 2006 was enough to help us crack the case. 
> 
> We finally figured out that the place with the wide stone walls was the Indian Hill loop trail in Sterling Forest State Park, which we hiked on May 29, 2006. That same message mentioned a hike we did the following day, to Black Mountain in Harriman State Park.

Hike at Indian Hill, Sterling Forest.  Beautiful hot day, lovely trails and lots of talk about ribs.  Furnace we could barely approach.  Lying in the sun for a few minutes after our lunch, but it was too hot.  Skinks.  After hike, exploring very nice visitor's center and models, looked at other furnace that is for some reason decorated to look like a town hall(?) or Greek building.  Too much PI to get close.  Parked at the corner and looked for the blue trail. Walked up road and realized we were on the blue trail.  Looked at mining ruins ("open pit" -- is that an invitation?)  Neat brick silo-like structure and lots of concrete building ruins.  Dinner at outback (ribs, of course!)
