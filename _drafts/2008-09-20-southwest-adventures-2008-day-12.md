On the suggestion of Rita from PF Visitors Center, took the Beeline back to Phoenix.  MUCH better route than I-40 to Flagstaff and then south on I-17.  Extremely scenic, taking us through gorgeous mountains with pine forests, then cactus fields as we reached the lower elevations.  Stopped for quick meal at McD's in Payson.  Got into Phoenix right near the airport so it was very easy.  No trouble getting home.
