Morning Glory for breakfast again.  Sat on the benches near the gazebo (which was wet) in the fog.  R and I both had bagels with spicy cilantro cream cheese on the side, which is the best way to do it, we found.  Mom had almond croissant and blueberry danish and dad had blueberry streusel again and sticky bun. 

Next it was time for the walk around Jordan Pond, which mom assured us she was up for, but we still had our doubts. When we began it was still under very heavy fog and we could barely see the pond.  The fog cleared gradually as we walked.  Before long a loon appeared. We watched him paddle along until he found a good fishing spot, where he anchored himself and dove repeatedly down (porpoised) to pick off the fish as he found them under the surface. We stopped for photos on some of the bridges.  Mom was coming along OK, even on the mild rock scrambles, enjoying her first taste of wintergreen and spotting red squirrels and evidence of more.  Rich explained the talus slope and the construction of granite block retaining walls on top of which the carriage road was built.  We looked for bog plants (Jack in the pulpit, now turned to bright red berries on a long stalk).  The only place mom showed any real fatigue was while on the "world's longest bogwalk" in the final stretch of the hike.  She was fine once the pond house was in sight!

And so the popover lunch was earned by all. Mom and Rich got the popovers with lemonade (R) and iced tea (mom).  Dad got the chicken salad sandwich and a popover, and I got the lobster roll (which I shared with Rich) and an extra popover, so we each had two.  Very nice setting on the lawn as always, and by the time we were done the last of the fog had lifted from the pond so mom could see the Bubbles.  We spent a few minutes in the gift shop, where Rich bought me a new chain for my moose necklace, since the clasp on the original one broke a few days ago.

Then took the walk up Asticou Terraces to the Thuya Lodge and gardens. (We had to try twice for a parking spot, so in the meantime we drove around NE Harbor for a few minutes.) Spent a few minutes upstairs in the lodge library and had an idea that maybe the Fandango puzzle has something to do with the elaborate doors with symbols leading to the garden.  (Not that you would need to know about them ahead of time, but they might figure into the final solution once you arrive at the location?)

Dinner was at Havana.  We were able to avoid the large party that was supposed to have a reservation at 6:00pm. Began with a little tortilla chip with wild mushroom and a slice of parmesan. Then I got the watermelon salad with red and yellow watermelon, jalapeno goat cheese, cilantro, pistachios and microgreens with blueberry-lemon vinaigrette.  Mom and dad had filet with broccoli rabe, R had Jamaican jerk tuna with purple sticky rice, and I had NY Strip steak with chimichurri, roasted fingerling potatoes and green bean salad.  All had mojitos except dad, who had a Bar Harbor Real Ale.  Went across the street to MDI Ice Cream for a light dessert.  R had Madagascar vanilla, mom had salted caramel, dad had chocolate, and I had the honeydew-basil-cucumber sorbet. R and I liked the drawing of a goat on the wall!
