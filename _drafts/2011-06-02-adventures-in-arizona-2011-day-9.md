Moving on to Phoenix through Florence. Found CACTUS after a difficult search, washes all along the highway had been redone and it was at the first one that wasn't currently under construction, but had already been redone. We found RM 1 easily as well as the witness post, but all the dirt that had been plowed up over the area made us doubt we would find the station. We measured the distance and estimated the direction from the witness post. First attempt kicking and scratching at the dirt didn't yield anything but a few minutes later I tried again and eventually kicked at something metal! It turned out to be the mark, probably less than an inch below the surface but completely covered.  We needed some water and paper towels to clean it off, dried quickly in the hot desert air and sun.  RM 2 is gone, having been set into the old culvert that was recently replaced. 

VAH KI was our next find.  This was extremely easy to spot and in fact R spotted it from the road.  All three marks were in a line and just a few meters apart along a fence line. While we were taking our photos a man came zooming toward us on an ATV. Unlike the people at home, though, he slowed down and waved pleasantly as he passed (also of note, he didn't harass us about what we were doing, just left us alone). 

We were starving so we picked up a quick snack at Burger King and then went on to Casa Grande National Monument, where we saw neat ruins and learned about the Hohokam canals and communities and met an Indian woman selling jewelry made of turquoise and jade. 

If we thought we were hot before, when we got to downtown Phoenix we were REALLY hot! We immediately understood what is meant by "heat island." The asphalt radiates heat like a kiln.  However, unlike in the humid east, all you really need is a bit of shade and you cool off immediately in such dry air. A breeze is just a bonus—a very welcome one.

We found our way to the Phoenix visitors center (which was harder to find than you'd think it should be), collected some maps and brochures, and then drove to the hotel. It smelled of curry! We soon found out why when we met the Indian guy at the desk. But he was very nice and the hotel room, although small, was immaculately clean. We rested for a while as we browsed through the maps and brochures. Imagine this - Phoenix has a new light rail system! That's modern, on time, and useful! We were so thrilled that we could take it very near to our planned supper destination, the Four Peaks Brewery. It's less than a (very pleasant) half mile's walk from the Dorsey/Apache station. The walk has the bonus of making you extra hungry when you arrive! We enjoyed our well-earned beers and light fare while we watched a girl from my hometown win the National Spelling Bee. The walk back to the train was cooler, easier, and even more pleasant when you're full of beer and delicious snacks!
