We had the most bizarre experience this morning at the Black Friar. Last night we decided to go for a slightly heartier breakfast this morning, and the options were the Black Friar or the Sunrise Cafe. The Black Friar is closer, and we were both in the mood for the Eggs Benedict that we've enjoyed so many times before, so that was our choice. 

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery1" class="2by2" %}

As the first to arrive, we had our choice of seats, and we took the usual corner spot. Everything seemed fine until our eggs came out. The Hollandaise sauce was clearly broken (I mean it looked and tasted like thick curds of lemony mayonnaise) and the eggs were overcooked (not runny at all). 

I have never sent food back in my life. Of course, I've never had anything that was really inedible like this before, either. But I hate to make a scene, am generally very forgiving and tolerant, and often enjoy trying something new or that I wouldn't generally order anyway (as has happened a few times here and there: I've received the wrong option on a meal and never said anything). But this was truly inedible. 

It still took me several minutes of going back and forth to try to decide if I should say something. I eventually decided that any business owner would probably want to know if there was a problem so they could fix it, or perhaps remove the item from the menu for that day if there was a problem with ingredients or with the cook's skillset (as Rich had overheard voices from the kitchen that made it sound like the cook was in training). 

I wanted to discreetly notify the owner, but she was busy in the kitchen with the cook, so I very quietly told our server—far out of earshot of anyone else in the room—that I think there was a problem with the sauce, it seemed to be broken rather than smooth and creamy, and that the eggs were cooked a bit too much. He got the attention of the owner, who basically talked over my apologetic explanation just saying "We'll remake them, it will just take a little while. We'll remake them, it will just take a little while." 

OK.

So we waited, wondering what might come out of the kitchen this time, and wondering if we should just pay and leave before we received a second order that was just as bad as the first. Then the server came over and offered to make us anything else off the menu. That was nice, but we were in the mood for the eggs we had ordered, and honestly everything else on the menu is too large and filling for us. 

We were still trying to decide what to do when the owner came over to us and sat down next to me. She started off in hushed tones saying "Let me be straight with you," or something to that effect. OK, I figured she was going to say that the cook was new and hadn't yet learned the technique, and could we give them another chance. Instead, she turned on the tears and started sobbing something about her dog being at the vet, close to death, and she didn't know if it was going to survive and she was having a really bad day. 

Um, I can sympathize, but I still don't see what that has to do with the broken Hollandaise sauce. If you care about your business and your customers, and you can't be there for them on a given day with a certain level of service, wouldn't it be better to close for the day, stating "Family emergency" or something like that? Not only that, but three seconds before and three seconds after she talked to us, she was buzzing around the place like nothing was wrong. No crying, no phone conversations with the vet, no indication of stress or that anything was wrong. The most bizarre thing ever. 

But I think what got to me the most was that after she gave us the dog story, the next thing out of her mouth was "And don't you take it out on [the server]!" Like, what the ever living fuck, lady? I didn't say a damned thing to the server except to discreetly alert him about the problem because I didn't want to bother you, and then to consider but politely decline his offer of a substitute meal.

In any case, we decided to leave. We waited around at the bar for at least 10 minutes, fully expecting and willing to pay but being ignored, until we were finally "excused" and told there would be no charge. I still have no idea what that was about. We thought later that maybe _that_ was Queen Anne's Revenge!

Following that debacle, we were both in miserable moods and lacked an appetite. Still, we walked over to Mount Dessert Bakery mostly on autopilot, only realizing once we got there that we didn't really want anything. Nevertheless, we eventually chose a sticky bun (for me) and a plain croissant (for Rich). 

After I paid for our pastries, we noticed a small dish on the counter where they often sell little local-made crafty goodies. And wouldn't you know, there were a bunch of snake rings in there! I felt like the snakes were looking out for me after all, and I had to buy one. I chose a gold-toned snake, but there were also silver ones with little rhinestones. A little too "blingy" for my usual style, but they're snakes, so I might have to go back and buy one of those too.

It took us a while to figure out how we wanted to spend the rest of our day, after enjoying our breakfast pastries on the porch as usual, along with coffee, raspberry tea, and orange juice. Somehow we decided to head west again, to the "other side of the island," and check out Long Pond Fire Road, specifically to hike a portion of the Great Notch Trail, which branches off the fire road and which neither of us had hiked before.

We found easy parking right across from the trailhead, and someone was leaving just as we arrived. We noticed some trailbuilding materials right at the trailhead, and wondered what construction might be taking place. 

The trail began quite level and easy, with relatively easy footing although quite rooted in spots. It was also extremely peaceful and quiet, something sorely lacking in other areas of the island. Birds were everywhere during the first part of our hike: chickadees, sparrows, and a goldfinch all a-twitter in the treetops. We also spotted some huge dragonflies flying high above us.

Climbing higher, the trail became more rocky and eroded; it apparently sees a lot of drainage right down the trail in heavy rain events. The slope was still mild, so it wasn't too strenuous of a climb, but we still wanted to take it easy, so we turned around after just a bit more than half a mile. That was enough to get a taste of what the trail was like, and we can certainly come back.

Rich and I were looking for another quick activity after our morning hike at the Great Notch Trail, just off the Long Pond Fire Road. Benchmark hunting is always on the table, and it just so happened that there is a mark just a tenth of a mile south of where the Long Pond Fire Road emerges to Route 102 via Hodgdon Road. 

Because we were already pointed northeast where we parked for the hike and there wasn't really enough room to turn around on the fire road, we ended up driving the entire fire road loop after our hike. So then we had just over a mile to drive south along Route 102 toward K 16.

Rich pulled over on the wide shoulder on the west side of Route 102, right at the mailbox for house #1549, the house mentioned in the latest recovery note. I'm often hesitant to approach these houses, but I thought it was worth a try. Perhaps someone would be outside and I could ask permission to search, or maybe the mark wouldn't even be anywhere close to the house, and I could search without being seen.

I walked up the driveway and saw a large barn that appeared to be in use as a wood shop. And I heard someone working inside; it sounded like they were using a table saw. After a few seconds a man appeared, and he didn't notice me at first, but I eventually got his attention. I explained why I was there, and asked for permission to search for the benchmark. He said that this was his son's property so he knew nothing about where the mark might be, but that I was welcome to search around for it. He wished me luck.

I told Rich that we were free to look around, but he preferred to stay with the car, which makes sense.  Fortunately I found the mark quickly. I documented it with photos, and on my way out I showed the man my close-up photo of the disk and pointed out its location.

The disk is is very good condition on a solid rock outcrop. It doesn't seem to be in much danger of becoming overgrown, but a witness sign would be helpful for others to locate it because the woods here are quite dense with vegetation and other rock outcrops.

After our miserable encounter this morning, I was so grateful to have such a pleasant interaction with this man. Although I'm sure he will never see this, to the kind man working at #1549 Tremont Road that afternoon, thank you for making my day so much better.

When I returned to the car, Rich was happy to hear how well it had gone, and he asked if I had any other benchmarks on my list in this area. Why of course! 

F 145 is another mark we can't believe we didn't search for in the past. We _may_ have driven by here once and not even attempted a search because of how thickly the area is overgrown, but we're not sure.

Today, with some coordinates from surveyor "JRO" in hand, and the promise of a witness sign at the site, we decided to give it another try. I spotted the witness sign immediately from the highway, and figured it would be a quick search. The mark was only 6 feet west of the sign, and there are only so many places it could be.

However, it actually took a few minutes of stepping off the distance and then clearing the accumulated vegetation to uncover the mark! It's hard to believe that in less than 6 years since JRO did his work here, a thick layer of dusty soil, roots, and moss had grown over the mark, completely obscuring it. If the datasheet hadn't listed the distance from the witness post, and if a tiny peak of bare rock sticking out from the vegetation hadn't given me some idea of where to dig, I may not have been successful in finding the mark.

The mark is in good condition in a very solid setting. My only concern for it is the fast rate at which it becomes overgrown. However, the witness post and associated directions should alleviate this issue, particularly for anyone who needs to use it professionally.

After the benchmark hunting, of course dinner was another highlight of the day. And by dinner, I mean Dinner! Yes, we went back to the new restaurant that took the place of Ciao. We were the first ones there and went right in at 5:00, but unlike last time, we were followed by quite a few other people, and by 5:30 the place was very busy. Strange, because tonight is a Wednesday, and it was much busier than on our visit last Friday!

We were very hungry this evening, and decided that we would try two different appetizers, both of which were delicious. We got the white bean dip, which was topped with romesco sauce and served with eight thin slices of sourdough baguette. This was a very hearty portion for an appetizer (sometimes in similar places you're lucky if you get three or four slices of bread!) and the flavor and texture were perfect. Mild, smooth but retaining some of the "bean" texture that we like, and the romesco added a touch of sweet red pepper flavor. 

Our second appetizer was mushroom ragu, a variety of mushrooms served on top of a light, crispy fried polenta cake and served with a green sauce (that we need to check the menu to identify), and a few drops of a delicious red curry sauce. Outstanding, both! We joked that maybe it was the fancy bowls that made everything taste so good, and maybe we would have to get something similar for home.

Then our entrees ... also amazing! Rich but not too filing, and again perfect textures and mix of flavors. I got the "Belfast Lawyer," a lobster risotto with a big pile of tender lobster meat on top, a creamy sauce, and crispy potato flakes on top. Rich got the orecchiette pasta, also in a cream sauce (but different from the one in my dish) and served with chicken sausage and spinach. This also came with three slices of the toasted baguette on the side. We shared everything, as usual, and our meals were accompanied by two unique cocktails, the Grand Royale (gin, lemon juice, and champagne), and Meg's Cosmo. If we'd had room for dessert, we would have ordered the mojo shrimp again like we had last Friday, but we were much too full.
