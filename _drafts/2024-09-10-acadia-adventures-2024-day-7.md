We were planning on a relatively quiet rest day for today, and I figured that would fit in well with our plans to visit the Bucking Lobster food truck at the Northeast Harbor marina at least once this trip. We were sure to have a very light breakfast: just tea, coffee, and juice and one blueberry muffin that we split. 

Of course we needed to do _some_ exercise to earn our lobster, so we headed to Northeast Harbor to check out the Asticou Stream Trail.  I've noticed signs for it in the past, but we had never checked it out. Today we parked at the large parking area off Route 3 across from the azalea gardens. A short walk south on the sidewalk along the highway brought us to the southern trailhead for the Asticou Trail. The trail begins with some stone steps leading down into a small meadow. Within a few minutes' walking you're already at the northern shore of the harbor. For such a short trail, we were surprised by the number of constructed elements: wooden bridges, bogwalks, a stone bench, stepping stones. Beautiful and interesting! 

As we walked, we heard construction noise that got louder as we approached the area of nearby Asticou Inn. The Inn was a favorite of ours in years past, when we used to visit their restaurant at lunchtime for popovers. I had heard that the inn was closed this year for renovations, but these appear to be some _major_ renovations! The beautiful gardens down by the water are completely gone, as are the octagonal "huts" that served as lodging. We're very interested to see what the place looks like next year!

After completing the trail, we wandered into the azalea gardens across the street on our way back to the car. This is always such a peaceful place, and although it was moderately busy today, there was still a quiet and contemplative atmosphere.

We headed over to the marina around 10:40, hoping to be first in line for lobster tacos at the Bucking Lobster. We were first, but no tacos today! Their seasonal employees have gone, and they simplified the menu for the fall, unfortunately removing the tacos (and perhaps a few other items?) to streamline preparation. No big deal, as I had been wanting to try the quesadilla anyway, and it was still on the menu. We also got a classic lobster roll to try.

As expected, everything was amazing! We shared both dishes, of course. The lime crema and salsa were amazing accompaniments, as was the fresh blueberry lemonade we ordered. And the main dishes were such a treat. Although the lobster roll was much smaller than the ones we got at Young's, the meat was incredibly tender and juicy, and had a delicate seasoning (probably just mayo and parsley, but perfect). We sat at one of the nearby picnic tables. It was chilly at the harbor, and a bit breezy, although not as bad as last year when a gust came and blew away my last tortilla chip!

After eating, we talked about what we might do for the rest of the afternoon. Some benchmark hunting near Southwest Harbor appealed to both of us. We drove Sargeant Drive and then headed over to Route 102.

Q 144 RESET, at the intersection of Route 102 and Pretty Marsh Road, was the first mark we attempted. We parked in the fire department lot across Pretty Marsh Road, and I headed across the road to search for the mark. 
  
I could see the witness sign as soon as I got out of the car, so imagine my surprise when I entered this grove of pines and looked all around the witness sign without spotting the mark. I did, however, spot the line of flags that indicated an invisible fence, probably for the four labradors on the property mentioned by JRO in 2018. That made me nervous, so I took a quick photo of the area and went back to the car to compare my photo with the photo attached to the NGS benchmark datasheet.

When I returned to the spot, I still couldn't find any trees that matched up with those in the NGS photo, but I happened to turn my head at just the right time, just the right angle, and I thought I spotted something blue and slightly shiny half-buried in the pine needles. It was indeed the mark! It was about 20 feet into the yard, and I felt a bit exposed when trying to clean it off and photograph it, but no one bothered me. This one is likely in danger of being covered over completely with the pine debris; it is too bad that the witness sign was placed so far from the mark, but its placement was likely to keep it in the right-of-way of the roadway and not on the private property.

Next up was one of the old K-series USGS bench mark disks. We really enjoy finding these, and we have found most of the "K" marks around the island over the years. Somehow we had missed this one in the past (as in, we were simply unaware of it). In reading the description and recent recoveries, it sounded easy enough to find. Rich pulled the car over right in front of the Southwest Harbor Town Line sign. We immediately spotted utility pole #111, as mentioned in the description. I crossed the highway and plunged uphill into the woods—quite easy walking once you get past the thicket of weeds in the roadside ditch. Immediately I could see the witness sign placed by JRO in 2018 straight in front of me, about 70 feet or so. The disk was apparent on the ledge right behind the sign. 

Our third find along today's Route 102 benchmark run was A 145, and it was the easiest find of the day. We pulled off the road right before the mailbox for #180, and I could see the boulder (and the disk on top of it) all the way from the road. I was a little concerned because it was so close to the house, but there were no vehicles in the driveway and the house was dark, although I spotted a few open windows. I was able to photograph the mark without incident.

And finally, our fourth attempt for the day was S 144, which has intrigued me since I first began researching it a few months ago. The scaled coordinates from the datasheet are rarely to be trusted, but this benchmark appears on the USGS topo map, and those coordinates tend to be much more accurate (within the admittedly low resolution of the 24K topo map series). At any rate, they rarely put us more than 10 yards or so from the mark, and often much closer.   
  
So I figured we had a decent shot at finding this one. The only thing that made me a bit hesitant was the fact that professional surveyor JRO (who has found some other marks in this area that we were unable to find) made an unsuccessful search in 2018. Still, we figured that we would give it a try today, as long as we could find a safe place to park.

We found a reasonably wide pulloff directly across the highway (on the western side) from the ledge that we suspected held the mark, being the correct distance above the highway and the correct distance north of the utility pole that still sports the same number it did in 1962. I crossed the crazy highway and began to poke around carefully and thoroughly on the various faces of the ledge.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find the mark or any sign of the "arrow cut in the vertical side of the rock" - not only was that the aspect of this mark that had intrigued me the most, but if I had found it, it would have given me some idea where to clear off the layer of moss, lichen, and soil that had accumulated on top of the ledge. I did pull off a few of the larger pieces of dried moss with my hands, but it was a messy job and there was just far too much of an area to clear without tools or without a better idea of where to look. This would be another good place to use a metal detector! I would love to return with some tools, now that we've scoped out the area and know more about it.

Back at Rosalie's tonight, we were the first ones at the door by around 3:40pm. Not a problem to wait since it was a sunny, calm, warm evening, and the intoxicating aroma of Rosalie's pizza was surrounding us, making us even more hungry. We knew the wait would make the pizza taste even better once it arrived. 

While we waited, another older couple came to join the line. We began talking with them and learned that they had hiked the Cadillac South Ridge trail from Blackwoods Campground (out and back, I think) and had heard about how busy Rosalie's gets, so they came over immediately from the bus after finishing their hike. A few more minutes of discussion and we learned that not only were they from our state, our area of the state, but just a few towns down the line! Pretty amazing. (This is actually the second time that we've randomly met someone from our area in Rosalie's!)

The other couple stayed downstairs while we took our usual booth upstairs. We had one of our usual meals: small house veggie pizza (so we didn't earn a wooden nickel this time, but we just weren't hungry enough for a medium pizza) and two large Allagash Whites. The restaurant stayed quiet and wasn't busy at all until just before we were ready to leave, so there was plenty of opportunity for conversation about oldies music. The pizza was just the perfect size for us tonight, and the beers took us right over the top. We wouldn't need anything else for the rest of the night. We came back to the room and spent the evening watching a few videos, working on benchmark recoveries and notes, and researching what we might do tomorrow.
