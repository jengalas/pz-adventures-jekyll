Hibiscus: choose one
Palm Tree: choose one or two (see if R has any of these done; I thought he did?)


Chenille plant: choose one


Easy morning poking around the Ragged Edge, taking photos of the flowers and noticing the "owls" on the pilings. We spent the day relaxing and enjoying exploring Islamorada: Founders' Park (and all of the historical information in the visitors center there), finding benchmarks, walking some sections of the Heritage Trail and checking some bridges for benchmarks, coming across lots of people fishing in the perfectly clear-aqua water. Nice long hike through many habitats at Golden Orb State Park. We still weren't done with the day's adventures! I saw something on the map (or brochure?) about the Florida Keys Wild Bird Rehabilitation Center in Islamorada/Tavernier, so on our way back to the room we stopped there for a walk. It was fantastic! Supper - Green Turtle. Turtle chowder, key lime pie
