Breakfast (strawberry pancakes, cranberry juice for me; fried eggs, coffee for R at Jeannie's).  Then checked out Park Headquarters (in search of Pathfinders book, I believe) only to find it closed for the weekend.  Then we took a drive on the Park Loop Road checking out the flooding and waterfalls rolling down the cliffsides.  We located but did not document the MaineDOT BM on the bridge; decided to wait for a drier day to take photos.  Then spent _a lot_ of time exploring Thuya Lodge inside and out and reading through many of the books in the library!  The local history books were especially astounding, and they further stoked our interest in finding the remains of the Cog Railway (which is mainly why we were looking through the books in the first place), and in the Spouting Horn, which we first learned of through the books we saw there (I believe the Clara Barnes Martin book (link to Google Books?) was very helpful). It was a very cozy way to spend a chilly day when the rain just didn't want to stop!

We needed more comfort, so we made dinner reservations at one of our favorite places—the Burning Tree. We started out with the White Hen Clam Pasta, as usual, and I had Ida's Crab Cakes with Puff Crabby, again as usual.  Rich had swordfish with spinach, pine nuts (ack!ack! he says), currants, and tomatoes.  We finished with one of our favorite desserts, lemon mousse (for the mooses) with prune and red wine sauce.
