This morning began chilly, with temps below 50 degrees. Our early walk to Mount Dessert Bakery was pleasant and I was happy to see that the place wasn't busy at all when we arrived (it did begin to fill up, but only after we had already ordered). Rich tried something different today: an egg, cheese, and ham breakfast sandwich on an English muffin. Dad also had a sandwich, but his was on a sesame bagel. We also got two sticky buns and a blueberry hand pie for later in the day.

As we have been doing often this year, we brought our goodies back to the porch and enjoyed them here along with the usual interesting discussion, and peace and quiet all around. We chose to hike on Bar Island today when we realized that low tide was around 11am, which would give us plenty of time to explore. What we weren't expecting were the literally thousands of people over there. Again, I've never seen anything like this here in September and I would bet this is even worse than August most years. Anyway, we enjoyed our walk to the summit as much as possible given the long train of people most of the way there. Rich took a gorgeous panoramic photo from a viewpoint just below the summit. We were desperate to find relief from the crowds and Rich thought he remembered a loop trail from the summit that's not on the published maps, so we went into the woods looking for it. It was pretty obvious, although at first we followed a different path from a fork, and I went ahead to investigate, but when it became somewhat steep I suggested we go back the way we had come and continue on the other direction at the fork. This worked out fine and took us down a little-used path to the area that was marked as off-limits for some reason, that we had passed by on the way up. We had been hoping it would take us to the other intersection we had noticed on the way up, which was just a few yards down from the point where we emerged. I wanted to see if it would connect with where we were earlier, so I ran the trail to find out that yes, I was able to connect through to our earlier stopping point. It's always my preference to have options for loop hikes, and a hundred times better when there's no one else on those trails!

Continuing on down the main trail, we branched off heading toward the foundations along the southern side of the island. This was a little frustrating because dozens of people followed us, but we later learned that hte park service promotes this site now so it's not really "hidden" any longer. The foundations were really neat, including one long stone building and two fireplaces, and a short stone lined path leading to a patch of lily of the valley, indicating that there was probably once a cultivated garden in this spot.

"And when you visit a stupendously beautiful natural wonder, can you keep your voices down? Half the conversations I overhear along remote trails are about some problem with a boyfriend or an employer's bad habits. Last week, a family came down a trail near me and passed by the magnificent overlook I was contemplating - they never even looked up. The father was telling his 12-year-old son that his client's lawsuit was frivolous and his advise was to drop it. I guess some folks get away to focus rather than let go."

We continued west from the foundation and one of the chimneys, finding a well-worn but also unmapped trail, which we were thrilled to find led all the way back down to the main trail near the bar. We didn't see a single other person on the trail until we got to the intersection at the end, so this was great. It was also a bright, sunny, open trail with views across to the town of Bar Harbor, and only one wet spot that was easy enough to navigate.

When we were walking back to the bar, and almost there, my father pointed out what looked to be another unmarked trail to the right. It was in fact the trail to the glacial erratic I remember reading about online! Dad and Rich took a break while I went for another short trail run to check out the trail. It was easy to follow and led through open woods with a pine needle carpeting, and in the distance I spotted the boulder. Several trails wove through this area, and it was such a peaceful place overall that it would be perfect to explore and maybe even have a picnic another day.

Walking back along the bar we realized just how hot the day had become under full blazing sun. I borrowed Rich's hat for a few minutes because I hadn't brought one, and had regretted it. We had our sticky buns and blueberry pie waiting for us, so we shared those along with a beer while waiting and resting on the porch for the afternoon.

We had been curious about what was happening with McKays, so I called and to my surprise, got an answer. (Actually I wasn't sure at first because it sounded like the same guy whose voice was on the answering machine.) He was happy to give us a reservation for 5pm. We walked down and joined a line that was already forming (so crazy for September). But we had a decent table in a relatively quiet room, no complaints there or with the others seated there, who were relatively quiet. 

We were all looking for something light to eat, so Dad had caesar salad, Rich had clam chowder and bacon-wrapped scallops, and I had "pappas bravas" (seasoned fingerling potatoes) and the usual McKays salad, which is always very good. Dad had a Narragensett lager to drink, I had the Allagash White, and Rich had the Sebago Runabout Red ale. We passed on dessert because we planned to have something at MDI Ice Cream. Even Dad joined us and had something from there, the strawberry just like R, while I had the tart, refreshing lime-cucumber sorbet.
