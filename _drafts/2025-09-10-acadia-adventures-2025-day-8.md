Morning was leftover pizza on the porch while waiting for it to warm up, and then going into town for R's doctor's appointment.

We arrived early, as usual, and Marina at the desk recognized us immediately. She notified the doctor that we were there, and he popped out a few minutes later to take us back to the exam room. 

My immediate impression was that Dr. Reznik was a very kind and soft-spoken person. I liked that about him right away. We were also impressed by the way he carefully took down Rich's medical history, asking questions and commenting on the medications that Rich was taking in a way that made it clear that he was actually paying attention and was also keeping up with the latest guidelines. Other doctors we've seen recently tend to be overwhelmed and a bit scattered - and I understand why, and it isn't a judgment on them but rather on the system in which they have to work. But this seemed different, more like what I would expect from an old-time small town doctor. He discussed everything methodically and made sure we understood what he was explaining. He examined Rich and gave some suggestions about what to try, including calling in a few prescriptions to the local Walgreens, but letting us know that if the problem persisted, we should see a specialist.

After that we went to the Walgreen's in town, wending our way slowly and annoyed through the literal hordes of cruise ship passengers. Today was another 4000+ passenger day - but at least it's the last one until next Wednesday. While waiting for the prescriptions to be prepared, we took a run through Cadillac Mountain Sports and bought a running hat for me, then picked up the prescriptions and headed back to the room over the back streets in an attempt to avoid the crowds.

My afternoon run was intended to be a relatively easy one, and it was more or less. I had planned to run from Holland to Spring Street, then take the Great Meadow Loop around and either come back on Kebo (if I was feeling strong) or finish the top leg of the Loop and return again on Spring Street if I was feeling tired. But when I got to the top of the Spring Street hill, I couldn't find the entrance to the trail! It looked like there was some construction underway, but usually you can just go around it and then continue on the trail when they're doing this kind of work. I saw a guy sitting in a piece of heavy equipment and asked him how I could access the trail.

"Technically the trail is closed," he said. "We're doing some work on it." I asked if I could still access it further up, like near where it makes a corner on Kebo Street. "I don't know, they're working all along this section. But you can try." So I ran up to where the trail entered from Kebo Street and, although I had seen some work happening on that stretch that parallels Cromwell Harbor Road, I didn't notice anything happening at the corner. So I entered, and I was actually able to run the entire rest of the trail without issue.

There were no warning signs or any indication about the trail being closed when looping back around from the Park Loop Road, so I kept going, and then found myself popping out right behind the guy in the heavy equipment. I didn't want him to see me running by after he had just told me that the trail was technically closed, so I just bushwhacked through the woods bordering the cemetery and popped back out onto Cromwell Harbor Road. Now I had a decision to make: Spring Street (basically downhill the whole way) or uphill to Kebo Street, then a longer uphill, and then a very steep descent.

I was feeling OK, just extremely sweaty, so of course I went for Kebo. And it was pretty tough, but more than doable, and I loved the feeling of topping that last stretch of hill! The downhill was rough on the quads, but it can only help to build strength.

[Afternoon run - write more here about how part of teh Great Meadow Loop was closed and I had to go on the road, and then sneak back past the guy who had told me the trail was closed]

Red Sky is always a special spot for dinner. The food is understated but spectacular, and as long as people are considerate and quiet, the atmosphere is cozy and pleasant. We arrived this evening in Southwest Harbor with about 30 minutes to spare before Red Sky opened, so first we checked out the wine and cheese shop around the corner. The aroma of cheese (and, interestingly enough, olives) when we first stepped inside was intoxicating ... to someone who likes cheese, anyway, and we do. It really made us want to buy some (which is probably the point or at least a side effect of having so much cheese in the shop), but we decided against it because we didn't think we would finish the cheese while we're here, and we don't have a cooler with us to bring anything home this time. I did purchase their last jar of guava marmalade, which sounds amazing and which Elaine will probably like as well.

Back at Red Sky, we had a few more minutes to wait and the sidewalk was filling up with people ... including two extremely loud women. A quiet couple came up behind us and Rich said "Oh, please sit next to us!" "I gotcha," the lady said, glancing over to the theatrically cackling ladies. "You can listen to my nice quiet Southern accent," she laughed, possibly in reference to the extremely over the top New York accent exhibited by one of the women. We then chatted with them for a few minutes and gave some recommendations about where to hike and bike on the island. They had really enjoyed their carriage road rides and were looking for more.

As luck would have it, we were seated across from the nice quiet couple, but we had a small table sort of in a corner to ourselves, a table we've had and liked before. We were also thrilled to see that the louder of the two women was not actually eating at the restaurant but had apparently just been passing by when she entered into conversation with the other woman. Everyone ended up being quiet and well-behaved, which was a relief.

We began with their Summertime cocktail, made with Plymouth gin, grapefruit juice, St. Germain, and Grand Marnier. That was such a delicious combination! I could have had at least one more, but that would be well past my tolerance level. Still, it was an extremely drinkable and refreshing combination.

Our appetizers were old favorites: crispy polenta with mushrooms, Swiss chard, and balsamic glaze and smoked salmon served with goat and cream cheese ("ISn't it supposed to come with a goat?!"), capers, red onion, and house made sesame crackers. We shared them, as we always do. And for entrees, we tried both tagliatelle dishes: Bolognese made with beef, duck, and lamb, and one with a lemon ricotta sauce with arugula and Aleppo pepper. They were so tasty and so filling that we couldn't even consider dessert, even though they had a Belgian chocolate cake that sounded really good. We came back to the room to share some wine and watch a few videos before note-taking time and bed.
