Morning was leftover pizza on the porch while waiting for it to warm up, and then going into town for R's doctor's appointment [write more about the appointment]. 

After that we went to the Walgreen's in town, wending our way slowly and annoyed through the literal hordes of cruise ship passengers. Today was another 4000+ passenger day - but at least it's the last one until next Wednesday. While waiting for the prescriptions to be prepared, we took a run through Cadillac Mountain Sports and bought a running hat for me, then picked up the prescriptions and headed back to the room over the back streets in an attempt to avoid the crowds.

[Afternoon run - write more here about how part of teh Great Meadow Loop was closed and I had to go on the road, and then sneak back past the guy who had told me the trail was closed]

Red Sky is always a special spot for dinner. The food is understated but spectacular, and as long as people are considerate and quiet, the atmosphere is cozy and pleasant. We arrived this evening in Southwest Harbor with about 30 minutes to spare before Red Sky opened, so first we checked out the wine and cheese shop around the corner. The aroma of cheese (and, interestingly enough, olives) when we first stepped inside was intoxicating ... to someone who likes cheese, anyway, and we do. It really made us want to buy some (which is probably the point or at least a side effect of having so much cheese in the shop), but we decided against it because we didn't think we would finish the cheese while we're here, and we don't have a cooler with us to bring anything home this time. I did purchase their last jar of guava marmalade, which sounds amazing and which Elaine will probably like as well.

Back at Red Sky, we had a few more minutes to wait and the sidewalk was filling up with people ... including two extremely loud women. A quiet couple came up behind us and Rich said "Oh, please sit next to us!" "I gotcha," the lady said, glancing over to the theatrically cackling ladies. "You can listen to my nice quiet Southern accent," she laughed, possibly in reference to the extremely over the top New York accent exhibited by one of the women. We then chatted with them for a few minutes and gave some recommendations about where to hike and bike on the island. They had really enjoyed their carriage road rides and were looking for more.

As luck would have it, we were seated across from the nice quiet couple, but we had a small table sort of in a corner to ourselves, a table we've had and liked before. We were also thrilled to see that the louder of the two women was not actually eating at the restaurant but had apparently just been passing by when she entered into conversation with the other woman. Everyone ended up being quiet and well-behaved, which was a relief.

We began with their Summertime cocktail, made with Plymouth gin, grapefruit juice, St. Germain, and Grand Marnier. That was such a delicious combination! I could have had at least one more, but that would be well past my tolerance level. Still, it was an extremely drinkable and refreshing combination.

Our appetizers were old favorites: crispy polenta with mushrooms, Swiss chard, and balsamic glaze and smoked salmon served with goat and cream cheese ("ISn't it supposed to come with a goat?!"), capers, red onion, and house made sesame crackers. We shared them, as we always do. And for entrees, we tried both tagliatelle dishes: Bolognese made with beef, duck, and lamb, and one with a lemon ricotta sauce with arugula and Aleppo pepper. They were so tasty and so filling that we couldn't even consider dessert, even though they had a Belgian chocolate cake that sounded really good. We came back to the room to share some wine and watch a few videos before note-taking time and bed.
