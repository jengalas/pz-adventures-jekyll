How do you carry a cactus (or two) onto a plane?  Well, very carefully! 

We had a project in mind for the morning-building a cactus enclosure to try to get them home on the plane. Our plan was to get some bunz from Bob's Bunz, bring then back to the room to eat, then R would work on the cactus box while I took my shower and got ready for our day. Traffic was very light and we had no trouble getting to Bob's Bunz quickly, but we noticed right away that they had almost nothing in the pastry case. We asked the girl at the counter is they had anything else. "Nope, what I have is what I have," she said. "I guess the baker wasn't in this morning. Oh-there he is now." Apparently some days he comes in at 4am and other days not until 7:30. We were able to find a few things we liked among the slim pickings: an Apple blossom again, a black forest pastry with chocolate, cherry and sanding sugar, a raspberry puff, and a mini key lime Bundt cake. As planned we ate them, along with our coffee, tea, and Indian River Honeybell Orange juice. Rich made a great cactus cover while I got ready for our next adventure. The weather was still extremely breezy, very warm and somewhat cloudy. We could see on the weather radar that sounds were passing over Layton, which was one of our possible destinations. Our other idea was to visit the Wild Bird Sanctuary to the northeast (the opposite direction) but we decided to take a chance and head southwest, and leave the sanctuary for later or tomorrow morning. It turned out to be a very auspicious decision.
We drive through a few showers on our way to Long Key, but they were light and brief despite the look of impending doom in the skies. As soon as we arrived at the park, the sky began to lighten, although it was still cloudy. Three people were gathered at the beginning of the Golden Orb trail and we met several others along the initial boardwalk section of the trail. Rich could tell right away that something interesting was going on. "Let's find out what all these people are so excited about," he said. Two women who were self-proclaimed weirdo-birders explained that it was a rare (in Florida) dove from the West Indies. It had been seen in the park for the last couple days, and one man even drove all night from nOrth Carolina to Sr it. We eventually figured out that it was a Zenaida dove. They look very similar to morning doves, especially the females. We still didn't ever expect that we would see it because we really had no idea what we were looking for, and of course in the interest of reducing weight on this hot and humid day we had left the binoculars in the car.
But this time, luck was on our side. The entire trail was abuzz with birders in their excitement over the dove. One couple told us that wet could see it near the next metal sign(for the nature trail) We figured it would be long gone by the time we got there, but surprisingly the dove was still in the area.It had just disappeared into the woods when we arrived the spot, but we waited for a few minutes and she emerged, to everyone's delight. It looked much like a smaller, chubbier mourning dove but with white on the ends of its wings. It exhibited pretty typical dove-like behavior, although we didn't hear the coo. I wonder if there was a male (which looks similar but has a blue-purple patch on its neck) somewhere nearby.
After a good 20 minutes or so of watching the dove, we sneaked by by going of the trail and down to the beach, where we spotted more, but smaller, man o war jellyfish like saw the other day at Bahia Honda. We took a few photos of the bird from the other side once we reemerged onto the trail, and then continued on.
Along the way we saw and photographed many nickerbeans, prickly pear cacti, palm trees, poisonwood, etc. a we walked through the different environments from windy beach, mangrove glades to desert-like prairie with succulents, sea grape and poisonwood to hardwood hammock at higher elevation that hosted gumbo limbo and acanthocereus cactus everywhere. We didn't see the eponymous golden orb spider this timebut the rare bird sighting more than made up for that! We also noticed something interesting with the cacti here, juvenile segments interspersed with adult segments. Very strange!
At the enf of the trail we decided to drive toward the campgrounds at the western end of the park supposedly there add s tri station STATE that had never been recovered. Wet soon saw why.The areas of covered in sea grape and white the Mark might early still be :in place, we find neither it nor either ref mark. The Australian pines that were used as references were nowhere to be found; perhaps because they are invasive and allelopathic, they were removed at some point?
We were hungry so we next checked the GPS for done idea what was nearby.We saw Habanos Oceanside, and I briefly checked the reviews using my phone it looked good so of we went! Although this wad the first time, wr think, err actually used the GPS to look for a place to eat and then actually ended up there, funnily enough the coordinates were wrong and wet actually had to continue northeast a few tenths of a mile beyond.
It was so worth it. The place wad fabulous. Despite reviewers comments about poor service wet find that once we were initially waited on the service was fine and the food came out quickly. We ordered iced teas (nice and dark, came with a slice of lime) and the roast pork with rice, black beans and fried ripe plantains, and a small Cuban style pizza. The pizza wad good, thicker breadier crust than w e typically like but we knew to expect that fin having seen others pizzas at other tables. We liked the crispy brown crust on the edges. The roast pork wad from another universe. Tender, most, completely faling apart, probably in a mojo sauce, served with thinly sliced marinated onions and the aforementioned sides. WOW!!! And all for 9.95.
Pleasantly full we went back to the room to clean up a bit and then headed east ti the wild bird sanctuary. It too provided a beautiful walk and lovely afternoon with the recuperating birds. We saw pelicans and ibis, egrets and herons, hawks owls and vultures, and shorebirds. W watched the pelicans get fed fish and talked with a green parrot who knew Hello, Goodbye and Come Back, along with some other phrases we couldn't understand. After walking through the main section we visited the other section with the parrot and songbirds and then followed the boardwalk back to the parking lot.it's a very enjoyable way to spend an hour or two and a worthy cause staffed by people who truly care.
We relaxed for a little while back at our room before walking to nearby Puerto Vallarta Mexican restaurant for supper. We were both still kinda full and didn't feel like driving it having another large meal so this wad perfect. We shared a HUGE pitcher of Negro Modelo and an order of shrimp enchiladas with green sauce and lots of cilantro-great! We also really enjoyed their chips and salsa which was very fresh tasting and contained a delicious bright acidic pepper that we both really liked. The beer wad great too and we walked back to the room pleasantly full and quenched and talking about days past.

Attempt to identify cacti: one with "hair" seems to be Eriosyce senilis (which was my absolute first thought, for some reason, even though I've never seen an Eriosyce in person before). I was stumped on the other one (other than being pretty sure it was a Parodia) until tonight when I stumbled across Parodia mammulosa. Funny thing is, its common name is Tom Thumb, which is a common gas station/convenience store in FL and a few times during the trip we'd say things like "Turn at the Tom Thumb" etc. Pretty cool coincidence!
