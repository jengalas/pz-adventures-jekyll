Mesa Verde/Cortez -- Shiprock -- Chinle/Canyon de Chelly

Got up, checked out, then poked around in bookstores, and then left Mesa Verde, had breakfast in Cortez. Then we made our way to Chinle via Shiprock, where we stopped for gas and snacks.  Got to Canyon de Chelly, went to visitors center where we bought some books and signed up for the "moonlight hike." Went to check in but our room wasn't ready, so we checked out the first several overlooks (up to White House) before returning, checking in, and getting something to eat at BK. Rested for a few minutes before the Death March! "This is like some kind of forced march!!!"

Food: El Grande Cafe: green chile omelet, hash browns, English muffin; steak omelet with cheese, wheat toast, biscuits with gravy (R); coffee. Burger King: Whopper; grilled chicken sandwich (R); onion rings, iced tea.
