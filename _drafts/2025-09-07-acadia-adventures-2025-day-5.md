We've expected for several days now that today was going to be a complete rest day due to the weather forecast of all-day heavy rain. And that did occur, both the rain and the resulting rest day. We had our usual quick breakfast of yogurt, muffin, and half a slice of leftover pizza, along with the usual drinks. We braved the chill and sat on the porch to eat, although we didn't last long out there.

The rest of the very rainy day was spent reading and researching and discovering a new abandoned trail to search for near the old (also abandoned) Southwest Valley Road, which we had no luck finding when we tried searching for it from its western end last year. We still might be able to find some sign of it if we search the eastern end. The new trail I discovered on the maps is the McFarland path (or road - it appears to have been a road at some point, later turned into a trail). The only time we left the room this afternoon was for some more tea and coffee, to get a few things out of the back of the car, and at some point I took a quick walk to Hannaford to pick up a few small items we'd forgotten the other day. 

We had been looking forward to our evening meal all day (well, for several days). Although our reservation was for 5:15pm we headed down a bit early, just in case we still might be able to grab our favorite front table. While waiting, we chatted with two women from Phoenix (possibly mother and daughter) and gave them a few restaurant suggestions to try while they are on the island. They didn't have a reservation, but were seated at the bar and hopefully they had a good time and enjoyed their meal.

As always, Dinner was fantastic. The first good sign was that we weren't seated at the tiny high-top table we had originally been assigned, but instead we were given a larger table by a window (just not one of the two front windows). It was actually a very cozy and relatively quiet spot, not too close to any of the other tables. So that worked out well.

We started with some cocktails, a Black & Blue Manhattan for me, featuring rye bourbon, and a Grand Royale for Rich with gin and champagne. We'd seen the street tacos on the specials menu several times last year, and this time we had to try them. They were filled with steak and topped with our favorites: pickled onions, poblano crema, cotija, and cilantro. We could have eaten at least 10 or even 20 of them! (Of course, we would prefer an even number so we didn't have to worry about cutting one in half, so we'd have to get 4 or 8 orders, actually).

Next came our entrees, which were equally amazing. Rich's pork schnitzel with sherry mushrooms was huge! We could hardly believe it. (In these places, the portions are typically quite small, which is fine with us).  But somehow, working together, we managed to finish it all. :grin: I ordered halibut, always my favorite, and it was as good as we expected, coated in panko and lightly fried, and served with mashed potatoes and a kimchi puree. We shared both entrees and enjoyed them equally.

By now the restaurant was really filling up, and even though it was getting a bit loud, it wasn't bothersome, and we could still hear one another just fine. Definitely an overall pleasant atmosphere. We were so cozy that we even opted for dessert - carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. It was even better than it sounds! The frosting was perfectly tangy and the edge of the cake, rather than being dry as they sometimes can be, was reminiscent of sticky toffee pudding, for some reason. It was served with two fresh strawberries (the only two really flavorful strawberries I've had all year), a dollop of whipped cream, and a scoop of caramel ice cream, and drizzled with caramel sauce. It's far more decadent than what we would usually order, but it was absolutely delicious.

It was still drizzling just a bit as we walked back to the hotel, very happy to be able to warm our hands on the heater (set to 78 degrees) as soon as we returned.
