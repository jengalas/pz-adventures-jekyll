Today was a rain day, and mostly a rest day. Originally I thought we would just get some pastries from Mount Dessert, but it was too cold to eat on the balcony, and I think we were both in the mood for a little more. So we ended up at the Black Friar again. I originally wanted blueberry pancakes, but ended up with Eggs Benedict again (with spinach this time). I just can't resist them! R got regular buttermilk pancakes which "coudl have been great!" but they were served with cold/frozen butter. At least they use real maple syrup. It was warm and quiet int he Friar, which is always aplus. The server was obviously new and clueless, quite a change from the young woman we had there yesterday.

IT was still raining after we finished our breakfast, so we walked back to the room and enjoyed doing some historical research for ther est of the morning. We were trying to decide what to do for the day (noticing that it had mostly stopped raining) when I had an idea to check on the hours of the BH Historical socoety, which the last time we visited consisted of a few small rooms in an old brck building (old schoool or convent?) on Ledgelawn Ave. I knew they were only open a few days a week and for a few hours, but I thought it was worth a try. Well, little did I know that three years ago they moved to a mansion on WEst Street, La Rochelle, built originally c. 1903 by the Bowdoin family and most recently housed the Maine Seacoast Mission. It appeared that they were now open every day, 10am-2pm. Sounded great! We headed right out the door and down to West Street.

IT was simply beyond all of our expectations. A three-story mansion, many rooms are restored and the exhibits are beautiful designed throughout the various rooms. The history of Bar Harbor is presented through artifacts that weave together the legacy and development of the park with the evolution of the village of Bar Harbor and with the Bowdoin family itself, and all their connections to everyone else working and playing in the area at the time. 

We didn't really have supper, but instead went to Side Street Cafe for a late lunch (around 2pm). We actually tried Paddy's first, but they didn't have clam chowder like we were hoping, and there were at least three screaming toddlers in there. The whole downtown was totally insane today, actually (maybe because of the weather, but it really has just been way too busy for over a week now). So we headed to Side Street, which was marginally better. (The table with two screaming older-than-toddlers-and-way-too-old-to-be-screaming-like-that kids left, fortunatley, just after we sat down.) The atmosphere inthere is still too loud for us, but at least it quieted down a litle bit after they left and we could hear some of our conversation.  We had beers (Cream Ale for R and Tubular IPA for me) and we each had a lobster roll. We also got an order of fries since we can get plain fries there (no seasoning) and prefer them to chips. No room for dessert, although we ate so early that we had plenty of room later for a sip of wine and a few cheese & crackers while we researched more Acadia history! Don Lenahan's blog, although he doesn't seem to be updating it anymore, is still a goldmine of fascinating history. Tonight we read about everything from St. Katharine Drexel to the Campbell's soup company to Dole pineapples and how they are all in some way connected to the island.
