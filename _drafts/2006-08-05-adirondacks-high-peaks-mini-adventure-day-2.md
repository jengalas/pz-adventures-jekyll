Although our alarm was set for 5:00am, it was quite a bit later (probably around 6:30) by the time we finally managed to drag ourselves out and get moving. Breakfast at our little table was ham and cheese sandwiches and papaya lemonade, but it was quick because we wanted to get on the trail early. 



We found parking at the Adirondack Loj trailhead and then began our long, gorgeous trek to Avalanche Lake. (describe in detail - look at map!) Remember the spindly trees at the beginning, great conversation, dam, snakes, too many people!, evil steep section, red raspberries, little boardwalks, rock scrambles and ladders once we got to the lake, cliffs/canyon, R. resting. We were dying on the way back but made it to the car by 6:30pm, barely able to move! Back in the room for a while, we had a big decision ahead of us â€” where to eat? We considered the Brown Dog Cafe, but as soon as R. saw the Hungry Trout menu, he knew we had to go there. We shared an excellent meal of steak/gorgonzola rolls, duck ravioli, crispy roast duck and venison, all with loganberry sauce! We decided to pass on dessert and just clear off a table so we could have some fun together. :) We took a lovely drive back under a bright moose-moon, and crashed in bed after our long and active day. Our rest was broken only by Rich's wild leg cramps!
