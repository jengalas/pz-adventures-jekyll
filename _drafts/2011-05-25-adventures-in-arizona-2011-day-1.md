The less said about today, the better! True nightmare! All was well until a cool, heavily tattooed guy scrunched up in the corner of the Scranton airport started muttering to himself something about the flight to Chicago being canceled. WHAT?! It wasn't much longer before we all found out the truth - he was right. don't believe the airport staff if they tell you an agent will come to the gate to help rebook you. By the time we went back downstairs to try to rebook on a different flight, we were about 10 people back in line. Two and a half hours and much haggling, frustration, etc. later, we were finally booked on the 1:16 flight to Philly, 3:15 flight to Cincinnati, and 8:35 flight to Phoenix. Not optimal, but at least it was something that should eventually get us to Phoenix by around 9:30pm. (remember the other couple in line and how they kept getting better arrangements than us, but his ticket didn't print out correctly so he had to go back to the counter, both downstairs and upstairs.) Fortunately both our tickets printed so we were all set, until we got to the new gate and discovered that the 1:16 flight to Philly was delayed until 2:30! There was no way they would allow us to stay on our booked arrangement because we would not be able to make the 3:15connection. After several attempts and phone calls to someone unknown, the USAir agent (who did show up at the gate as promised, unlike The AA agent) he managed to get us on an 8:35 flight direct from Philly to Phoenix.  This meant that we could stay on our 2:30(or whatever it turned out to be ) flight to Philly and would still have plenty of time to make the connection.  It also cut out one leg of the trip, which was especially important because it seemed that Cincinnati could easily be in the path of the same thunderstorms that had plagued Chicago earlier (and for most of the day). We told the other Phoenix bound couple about our change of plans but they eventually chose to (or had to, because I thunk we got the last seats on the direct flight) to take a later connecting flight from Cincinnati.  But this meant they had only 45 minutes to connect to the 8:35 flight, and they had to switch terminals.  Too rich for my blood! I wonder if they ever made it to Phoenix that night.  I kinda felt like we were on the Amazing Race.

Our flight to Philly was quick and uneventful, once it finally took off, but then the waiting began. We withstood six hours alternating between boredom, frustration, and the stress of wondering whether we'd ever get there.  The incoming plane was late too, so that added another layer of delays.  Once we finally started boarding, the passengers' relief was punctuated once again by an insanely shrieking emergency exit door alarm set off by an oaf of a guy who leaned on it (then pretended he didn't, like someone who had just laid a huge fart and then looked around "to see who had done it.") Then, the flight was delayed again because of a broken overhead compartment—seriously! At this point most of the passengers probably wouldn't have cared if one of the wings was broken. We were so overtired, frazzled, sticky and frustrated at everything out of our control that it wasn't hard to imagine how people can go crazy in these situations.  At this point we just wanted to get on the damned plane, knowing that we still had eight hours ahead of us: 5.5 hour flight, retrieving luggage, getting rental car and driving to Tucson, before we could sleep!

Finally, the plane left at around 9:00pm.  We were routed around the still-raging Midwest storms, so the flight wasn't expected to arrive until 11:30pm, Phoenix time (this is 2:30am EDT, meaning that by landing time we would have already been awake for over 22 hours, for those keeping track at home).  We were wrong if we expected a peaceful flight so late at night.  It was the typical zoo, with crying kids and the woman sitting next to R working feverishly on her laptop all night who kept literally banging on the space bar, and a guy in front of us playing Fishdom (that was actually cool).  

[Something about only having two rental cars available by the time we got there, and how we got this crappy one that wouldn't go above 55mph without shaking]
