Our day in the Everglades began in our hotel room, with a quick breakfast of juice and last night's guava pastries from Publix (they were still great). Then we drove to the park and went directly to the benchmark (S 432) that we had found but not photographed yesterday evening.

This mark is right at the intersection with the unpaved road that leads south toward triangulation station KARR, which was also on our list. The road is technically part of the Long Pine Key Nature Trail, a short section of which we hiked yesterday when we first entered the park.

Owl sighting at Mahogany Hammock trail, lots of BMs, Snake Bight trail with bromeliads and LOTS of mosquitoes and other bugs!
