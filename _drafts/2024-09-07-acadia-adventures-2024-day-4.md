This morning felt very different from the past two days. Beneath heavy clouds and very humid air, we began our day with Rich picking up some coffee and tea from the lobby while I took my morning run over to Kennebec Street to see if the Flowered Apron was serving baked goodies this morning. Unfortunately, they weren't, so I ran back to the room and we picked up a blueberry muffin and yogurt from the lobby, both of which we shared.

While we ate breakfast on the porch, Rich noticed that it was starting to rain. It was a very light sprinkle/mist, but before long everything was wet. We went back and forth trying to decide what to do today and eventually chose to drive over toward Norway Drive, with the intention of hiking some of the abandoned Old Norway Drive, or at least seeing what the road conditions were like.

Following the directions from Matt Marchon's book, we found the parking area off Mill Brook Road easily, and noting that the trail surface looked pretty easily navigable and wasn't too wet, we started in on the trail. 

We hadn't walked more than a minute before out of nowhere, a medium-sized black dog (not sure of the breed) came flying up to us and lunged, pouncing with all its might, at me and Rich. It just kept forcefully jumping up on us, and scratched us both with its claws (fortunately, although the scratches drew blood, it was through the fabric of our pants and the claws didn't actually touch our skin). 

We were understandably furious. I kept trying to grab the dog by the harness it was wearing to try to keep it away from Rich. The stupid woman that owned the dog had absolutely no control over it, and just came walking up calling for the dog with no real sense of urgency. She muttered an "I'm sorry" and that was it. Still shaking a bit over that one.

Once we were settled, we continued on. We ended up walking about a third of a mile along the old road, plus a little detour off a well-defined trail to the left that led to a picturesque streamside and what would be an impressive cascade after a rainfall, but was barely a trickle today. I assume this is one of the cascades featured in Marchon's book chapter.

I was hoping to see some snakes in this area, but we were lucky enough to watch a hairy woodpecker for a few minutes, and then to spot a huge striped slug! We wanted to take it easy today, and it began to rain more heavily, so we decided to turn around and maybe try completing the hike of the abandoned road (on another day) from the north end. This would involve driving over to the north end of the road to scout out the access point, which is what we did. 

... although we didn't go exactly the way I was expecting, which was to continue north on Norway Drive, then turn right onto the Crooked Road, and then right again onto Old Norway Drive—and this turned out to be a good thing. Rich instead crossed the Crooked Road and got onto Old Norway drive at its northernmost point.

As we turned onto this northernmost section of Old Norway Drive, we noticed an orange NPS witness post—the type that often indicates a stone post and boundary monument disk at its base—in one corner of the intersection. I investigated it, but this one had no associated stone monument or disk.

But we didn't have to go much farther before we spotted not one, but two more orange posts, both with monuments at their bases! This was so cool. We could actually see the park boundary indicated on the GPS, so we knew to anticipate even one or two more of these monuments right along this small section of the road. And we found them, too.  All but the first had stone posts with unstamped NPS disks on top. I enjoyed finding and documenting all of them.

This is a good place to mention that we also found another very interesting monument of some kind across from the southern end of the road, a concrete obelisk that looks an awful lot like 19th century survey monuments, although it had no carvings or inscriptions on it. We will have to investigate this further.

We then crossed the Crooked Road again and drove down the next part of Old Norway Drive, which took us to a barrier with a "POSTED - Private Property" sign. I have my doubts about this being private property, although I can somewhat understand why people who live in the area might want to claim it as such, to keep meddling interlopers like us from away ... away. 

In any case, although there was a nice parking pulloff here just as there is on the southern side, but with a house so close by and the clearly marked Posted sign, I didn't think it would be wise to risk it. I would love to complete the hike of the whole abandoned portion of the road, but we may have to do so by beginning at the southern end again.

It was still early in the afternoon, so we considered a quick trip to the visitors center, but changed our minds after seeing the busy condition of the parking lot. We continued on Paradise (Paradis?) Hill Road toward the overlook, where we arrived just about in time to grab the nice corner spot. 

Taking a walk downhill, we turned onto the trail leading toward the carriage roads, spotting a small frog along the way, and a ton of acorns (is it a mast year?). We hiked just a short distance on the carriage roads, down to the northern end of Witch Hole Pond, where we spent some time just poking around and photographing the various plants and scenes around us. It began to sprinkle again, so we headed back slowly to the car.

We were getting very hungry by the time we returned to our room, around 2:30pm. We had just enough time to get cleaned up and organized before heading down to Rosalie's for another pizza, which would be their amazing house veggie this time. We arrived around 3:45, and again were the second couple there. People are arriving earlier and earlier each year, it seems! A line formed by 4:00 when the doors opened, although it was a shorter line than on Thursday, and the place in general was much less busy for the first 30 minutes or so. 

We got our usual booth upstairs, and two Allagash white ales to start. The pizza came out quickly, and it was spectacular! We had been looking forward to it all year. We ended up getting a medium this time, although we usually just get a small. The thinking was that we could bring two slices back to the room to eat while watching the latest Blondihacks video, "as is tradition." (And there was no Blondihacks video last week, so we were really looking forward to that too!)

The restaurant grew busier as we ate and talked about regional neighborhood names, like the Patch, Grassy Island, Greenwood, etc. We are still trying to come up with the name of an area near Winton that Rich used to hear all the time, but can't quite remember right now. A slow walk back to the room was enough to help me work up a tiny bit more of an appetite, and about an hour later we did in fact watch the latest Blondihacks video, and I ate one of the remaining slices of pizza. Rich was still too full to eat anything else, but we both had a big glass of lemonade from the hotel porch. Spent the rest of the night reviewing today's photos and looking over the maps before bed!
