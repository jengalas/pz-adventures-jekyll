Our plan for breakfast was to get something simple from Mount Dessert Bakery, but when we arrived we found that they were closed today, supposedly due to staffing issues. So we walked down Cottage Street to try A Slice of Eden. It was busy there as usal, but the line moved quickly and they have a new system whene they call names over an intercom when your order is ready, and you pick it up at a tent outside. This worked out well. 

We ordere our usal tea and coffee, and a blueberry turnover and pecan sticky bun for later. To eat there, Rich got a croissant sandwich with egg and American cheese, and I got a salt & pepper bagel with olive-pimiento cream cheese, which was amazingly delicoius! I had initially wanted the usual spicy cilantro lime cream cheese and was planning on getting the olive another day, but they were out of the cilantro lime. We ate at one of the new tables on their patio, and then walked down to the waterfront to relax for a while. While sitting on a bench to chat we finished off the blueberry turnover (there's still some sticky bun left for later). Then we took a slow walk throug town, checking out Paddy's and a few of the shops along Main Street. We wandered through the plaza behind Testa's and found Graffiti Donuts - looked like a place Chrome from Van City Vna Life would like, but not so much our kind of thing. We also checked out the Rock & Art Shop, which is definitiely our kind of thing! Loved all the rocks and fossils, plants, and two snake skeletons! (There was also a "model" snake as wall art named "Sammy" that was really cute!)

Then we took a walk up to the Village Green, wanting to get a bus schedule for this season, which we did. They have made a few changes - added some routes that were never available before in fall, and reconfigured other routes, and now have a separate fall schedule instead of using the same one for summer and fall, with the fall times shaded. 

Whiel Rich folded our bus route sheets, I checked out the flavors at MDI Ice Cream. I was intrigued by the brambleberry "oat based" sorbet, and that's what I ended up getting. In a surpising twist, Rich got honey baed apple ice cream which isn't something I would expect him to like, but he did (we both did).

Then Rich proposed taking a short bus ride around and a stop at Thunder Hole just as another relaxng activity to get us into the park. We chose the Sand Beach bus, and one arrived quickly. Along the route I spotted an unmarked road leading off into the woods. When I went to mark the spot on my phone for furher exploration, I saw that I had already marked it before, but we never investigated it. Similarly, I spotted a boundary marker along Otter Cliff Road that I thought we had foud before, but it doesn't look like we had. I marked that spot as well for future exploration. Our time at Thunder Hole was spent on the rocks, just wandering around, sitting, watching. It was relatively quiet and peaceful even with quite a few people nearby.

The buses were not crowded but there were a few other people on each one we took.

We came back to the room and rested for a short while before heading out for and eary, much-anticipated dinner at Ciao.

On our way to dinner at Ciao, we stopped at the hardware store to look for an SD card adapter (they didn't have one but suggested we check Hannaford or Walgreens) and then wandered around A&B Naturals for a while. There are many interesting goodies in this "natural food store" that "smells like herbs". I could probably find something interesting for Mickie here (maybe some honey to go with the chaga tea). In fact I think I'll buy some blueberry and raspberry honey for myself too. Rich was very interested in the "Zucca" pasta that looks like little squash halves! I think that would be really cool to make (with sauce and zucchini? Definitely not pumpkin spice sauce!)

We took a slow walk down the block to Ciao and had about a 15 minute wait before they opened at 4:30. I was getting roasted by the sun, which was so strong today! A youngish couple came by to find that they wer second in line. They were very pleasant to talk to and we found out that they were from New Hampshire and visit here each year (him for 25 years, her for 5-6). They sat at he bar and I saw that she ordered the octopus crostini and burata. 

We began with a cocktail we had here before, blueberry lemon vodka with wild blueberries in the glass. So refreshing and colroful! Our choices for dishes were farmhouse salad with greens, tomatoes, and shaved pecorino, and fregola sarna salad with toasted fregola, eggplant, olives, peppers, cucumber spirals. Fantastic! Next came the she-crab soup with cream and sherry, probably the best soup I've ever had! And along with that we had large shrimp in a delicious garlic sauce. Finally, we had hanger steak with herb oil and flaky sea salt and roasted potatoes, and mushroom crostini (shiitake and oyster mushroom). WOW! One of the best meals ever. Dessert (particularly the lemon-blueberry olive oil cake) sounded great but we wer just way too stuffed to even contemplate it.

We finsihed off the evening with a walk on the bar (we didn't realize until we got there that it was low tide and the bar was exposed). I played with a snail, trying to coax him out of his shell (it worked best to put him near water). When I was done with him I placed him back into the water and he immediately emerged from te shell to attach to a nearby rock. Cool! We also say many exposed barnacles, and empty mussel shells (one with a tiny dead sand crab inside). i was looking for an intact mussel and finally found one just before we turned around to leave.

On our way back to the road, we could hear a slight commotion and turned to see a doe and two fawns swiming quickly from the bar back to the main shoreline.

Rich went directly back to the room and I stoped at Hanaford for a few minutes before returnig to the room myself.
