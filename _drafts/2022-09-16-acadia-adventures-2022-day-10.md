Today was dad's last morning with us, and going to be mostly a rest day for us. After missing out on them yesterday we were determined to get crepes for breakfast today! So e got up early and got there the exact minute that they were placing the blueberry pie in the window and beginning to unlock the doors. Perfect! We got the 4-person table near the door and ordered our crepes. Unsurprisingly, Dad got his favorite strawberry-banana-nutella crepe and Rich got the veggie lovers crepe again. I tried something new: the brie, green apple, and proscuitto. All were excellent! I would get the same crepe again, although if we do go there again this week I will probably try the smoked salmon crepe instead (actually that;s what I was planning on having yesterday).

It was a brisk morning, particularly by the ocean, but the sun was already warming things up significantly. It's traditional on Dad's last day (and often ours), as long as the weather is decent, to walk the Shore Path down to Wayman Lane and then walk back through town. It was still breezy and chilly but always a beautiful walk alng the shore. There was one rather small cruise ship visible in the bay this morning.

Dad left for Vermont around 9:00am and we took some time to figure out what we wanted to do today. We wnated a restful day after all the recent activity. I've been eager to check out this abandoned road that I've noticed while riding by on the bus a few times. It cuts across a smal triangle of land between the Park Loop Road and Route 3 in the vicinity of Sieur de Monts and Jackson Lab. We were unsure whether we wanted to try taking the bus today or parking at or near Sieur de Monts, but we were lucky enough to find a completely open parking pulloff along the Park Loop Road only about 350ft from the western end of the road. 

approaching the road it was clear that it had been a wide road and was still in quite good condition, although it wouldn't be passable now in acar because of a couple fallen trees across the roadbed. This road appears on the 1942 topo map (and earlier maps) and appears to have led into Robinhood Park, which was on the property where Jackson Lab now sits. Apparently this was hte former propoerty of Morrell, who dedicated a small greenspace park at the eastern end of the road to the people of the town of Bar Harbor. Supposedly at the Bear Brook picnic area on the other side of the lab there are some fence posts remaining from the old Robinhood Park. Lots more history to discover here!

After that little adventure which allowed us to add something new to our map, we venured into the Sieur de Monts parking lot and after waiting for a crew of (drunk?) yahoos to stop milling around, pulled into the one open parking space. It took a few minutes for us to figure out what we wanted to do, something at Sieur de Monts? Nothing realy was pulling us today so Rich suggested taking a drive up to see what the Burning Tree is like now. I know it has changed from a sit-down fine dining restaurant to more of a wine shop that also sells some fancy prepared foods for takeout, as well as some baked goods. 

It was a huge change from the last time we had been there many years ago! But interesting nonetheless. The wines looked interesting and prices were good. We just wanted a few snacks so we bought a cheddar and chive scone and a plum tart to eat outside in the garden. Both were excellent! The scone was just mildly oniony and cheesy and was very moist with a slight sweetness. The fresh plum tart was full of juicy fruit with just a hint of cinnamon, wrapped in a buttery pastry. We split them both in half and sat outside in the sun to enjoy. It was quiet and peaceful even though we were right alongside the road.

As we were leaving I noticed some red roud fruit on the ground, and looked up to see that I was standing beneath a plum tree! I had to ask if they were the plums used in the tarts. Of coures, they were. The yound woman working inside said they had just had their largest harvest of plums ever (145lb) and a few smaller harvests before that. They have lots of preserving (canning, jam, drying) to do.

After our little adventure there, we spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing unti it was time to head to Southwest Harbor for our dinner reservation at Red Sky. We wanted to go a bit early so we could get some cheese at hte wine and cheese shop next door.

Once in SHW we realized we wre really early, so we drove down Clark Point Roadt to check out the MDI Lobster and BBQ place. It wasn't busy and they have a nice tent to eat underneath. Could be worth checking out one day.

Then we went to the wine and cheese shop and bought a bunch of crackers, cheeses (Lamb Chopper, Midnight Moon, Smoked Goat), and some lemon cookies (that we sampled later in our room with wine). 

The larger Sawyer's Specialties shop is now about half the size, with the Little Notch Bakery taking up the northern(?) half and the inventory significantly reduced, for some reason. I saw an interesting blue cheese there that I wanted to try, though, so I bought some.

We also checked out Little Notch since we had some xtra time. It smelled great in there but we dind't buy anything today. Unsure if it woudl still be good by morning.

We wre still early but arrived at Red Sky and had no trouble getting a table. We started wit two beers (Bug Lager and Mason's IPA) and their smoked salmon spread on toasts. Then we split two appetizers - smoked salmon (I needed more!) with goat-cream cheese-caper spread and red onion on sesame crackers, and a salad of cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and crumbled goat cheese. All fantastic! It took a long time to receve our entrees, though. We both ordere the tagliatelle with almond cream sauce with basil, and topped with roasted red pepper sauce and grated parmesan. It was awesome! Just with there hadn't been such a mixup in the kitchen and we hadn't needed to wait so long. We were too stuffed for desert but they brought out a small scoop of vanilla ice cream anyway, which was good and just enough.

We enjoyed the drive back but dind't go through the park - we usually save that for later in our trip!
