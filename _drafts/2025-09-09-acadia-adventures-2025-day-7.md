We awoke to a sunny but very chilly morning! It was tough to get moving, but we got our usual light breakfast from the hotel lobby and sat on the porch for as long as we could stand it, talking about what we might do today. My idea was to run the Witch Hole Pond carriage road loop (following and logging the rest of the Fern Trail along the way, and also seeing if I could locate an old quarry) while Rich poked around and took some photographs near Duck Brook Bridge. This worked out really well! Rich got in a nice walk of at least a half mile and found a few interesting photographic subjects, and I thoroughly enjoyed my run and exploration of the area. (I followed the trail out to Paradise Hill Road without any problems, but I had no luck in locating the quarry this time.) There was only one other runner on the carriage roads at the time, and a few walkers, among dozens of cyclists. One group of ladies was a real hoot - one of them said "Impressive!" as I trotted up the steepest hill along the way, nearly keeping pace with them (for a short time) while her friend said "We're earning it - these AREN'T ebikes!" "I agree completely!" I said cheerfully. "No judgment but yeah ... I agree!" (You might have guessed that in 2025, the vast majority of cyclists we see on the carriage roads are riding ebikes. Anything that gets people out there is great, but it still doesn't give me, at least, the same feeling of accomplishment. I guess it all depends on your goals, which is just fine.)

When I returned to Duck Brook Bridge, I was very close to 7.5km, so I repeated a bit of the carriage road and turned around, hoping to make the 7.5km, which I did. Then I still felt good, so I continued running out to the road, where I ran into Rich coming the other way. "Gotta make 8k!" I said, as I ran past him. I did and then returned to the car where he was putting away his tripod.

He was interested in checking out Duck Brook Bridge, which we did, and then I spotted the entrance to the Fern Trail and thought I would show it to him. I originally found and followed it in 2023, when Rich was unable to hike and I was exploring mainly on my own. Well, today he hiked the entire path with me, and it was so much fun, like old times. The path was dry and much easier to navigate than the last time I was here. It is clearly well used - more than just a "brown trail" - with just a few areas of light overgrowth. Once we reached the other end where it intersects the carriage road (and after waiting for a large, loud group of ebikers to move along) I showed Rich where the other end of the Fern Trail picks up (across the carriage road, over the culvert), and then we began our hike up the carriage road to make a loop out of it. We were passed by an Amish/Mennonite couple on bikes (I assume not ebikes?) on the way, wearing traditional dress, which I thought was cool.

Most of the cars had cleared out from alongside Duck Brook Road by this point. We headed out, planning to make a quick stop at the park HQ to check on the progress of whatever they're building, and to see if we might be able to access whatever little access path to the Aunt Betty carriage roads is shown on the old map. Well, whatever is happening there is still under construction, and we could see that we wouldn't be able to get near that access path, if it even still exists. We'll have to check it out next time.

And next, you guessed it, it was time for a lobster roll! Rich suggested it and I couldn't resist. He dropped me off at the small lobster stand near the park where I got us a lobster roll a few days ago, and he planned to drive around until I was ready. It didn't take long at all today. There was only one lady in front of me, and she had just finished her order, so I basically walked right up and placed my order (another large classic roll). It didn't take more than three minutes before the roll was ready and I had it in hand. I had to wait another 5 minutes for Rich to circle around again. But we brought it right back to the room and enjoyed it so much while sitting on the porch (still freezing!).

After all the lobster, we were looking for a light and easy supper, so Rosalie's it was. All afternoon while we did some local history research, we were going back and forth whether to get takeout pizza again and bring it back to the room, or go there and deal with the crowds and noise. We eventually decided just to go to the restaurant to eat the pizza fresh out of the oven, and have a nice tall beer to go with it. It was a great decision!

When we arrived around 3:45, there was already a line of at least a dozen people waiting at the door. (Was there a bus, or what?!) This isn't entirely unusual, that there is a lineup already well before opening time of 4:00pm over the past few years, but I don't ever recall seeing that many people ready and waiting.

It wasn't too much of a problem, though, as they were all clearly new to the establishment and herded into the downstairs to find tables and place their orders, while I trotted quietly upstairs, claimed a booth, and asked the woman at the upstairs counter if we could place our orders there. (The sign specifically asking customers to do so was not posted today.) She said yes, so I went downstairs and pulled Rich out of the long line, and we both headed upstairs to order. Perfect!

We had been planning to get a small pepperoni pizza but ended up ordering a medium, which means we ended up with another token and some extra slices for tomorrow's breakfast. The giant beers were most welcome after the good workout we had today, and the pizza came out hot and with perfectly thin, crispy pepperoni on top. The atmosphere was actually relatively quiet until a group of five 40+ "bros" (I don't know how else to describe them) arrived and sat down at the table right next to us. My first thought was "at least it's probably better than a group of cackling women," but Rich said, "I don't know, just wait until the rulers come out!" Fortunately we were almost done and so didn't have to experience much of the sausage party. Instead we just had a great meal and conversation as usual, reminiscing about old times while enjoying the old-time music (70s and 80s are good, but the first time I hear 90s music in there, I'm out!)

I wanted to make a note about the pizza-cutting jig that we saw one of the employees using to cut the stuffed pizza while we were waiting for the restaurant to open. Rich said that we need one of those!

Although we were too full to have dessert, we still wanted to check out the offerings at MDI Ice Cream, because we haven't even gone by there yet (we usually check it out on the first night). They had a few flavors that were very enticing, such as peach, cinnamon-cardamom, sweet basil, pineapple pimenton sorbet, and of course blueberry basil sorbet. But we'll have to wait for another night to try them.

The night was still young when we returned to the room, so we spent some time relaxing while watching a few videos before reading, note taking, and bed.
