Sunday morning: what to expect? If the line at Jordan's was any indication, we would be waiting quite a while for coffee and tea to go with our breakfast. Fortunately, it wasn't. We were able to walk right into Slice of Eden--a far cry from yesterday when it took a long time to even reach the counter. We ordered coffee and tea, to go with the lemon-blueberry cake left over from yesterday, and rich decided to get another breakfast sandwich, this time with spinach. We walked back to the room on sidewalks that were already getting a little more busy.

Breakfast on the porch was as fun and relaxing as it has been all week. We still had no idea where we wanted to hike or explore today. I eventually suggested the Lake Wood/Fawn Pond area that we were discussing yesterday, and R was interested. So off we went! 

It was a relief to see that there were no cars parked at either Lake Wood parking area. Rich has brought me to this area before (although we never went past the sunbathing ledges) and we knew that we wanted to begin at the woods road that starts a short distance east of the final parking area nearest the lake. We walked in a southerly direction along and above Lake Wood, heading toward a GPS waypoint I had labeled J FAWN. I had downloaded these waypoints years ago from the "GPSAcadia" guy and have found them to be very useful. Although I hadn't previously looked into this one, I was assuming it meant "junction to Fawn Pond" and that was exactly what we were looking for.  

The trail to that point was pretty easy to negotiate. There was one steep section just south of the ledges, but after that, once the trail leveled off again alongside the lake, it was easier walking (just a bit rocky, rooted, and damp from the high water level). We soon came to the J FAWN waypoint and what looked to be just a drainage running downhill. I was skeptical but we followed it anyway, and it did indeed turn into an obvious path as soon as it began to level out. The path took us directly and very quickly to Fawn Pond.

What a peaceful spot! There are lilypads everywhere, and pitcher plants, one of which was in bloom. We first decided to hike along the northern shore in an attempt to find the plaque to Charles T. How. The trail was a bit trickier to find here, but we were able to make our way to teh ledge into which the plaque is set without much trouble. After that, the sloping bank became too steep and slippery, and we decided to turn back and try to find a route along the southern shore instead. This would more likely lead us toward any road or path coming up from Breakneck Road, anyway.

Rich waited while I scouted the area. It was relatively easy to spot the trail leading off from a ledge (the only slightly tricky spot to reach). The trail itself was very easy to follow, wooded, and easy to run. I ran it down to a junction with a wide woods road, turned left and very quickly came to a stream. I didn't want to go further but I was quite close to the pond at this point. I suspect this was the spot where was saw 3 women standing earlier when we were on the north side of the pond, and it seems likely that they came here from the Breakneck Road area or maybe somewhere else in that general area. I did not see them and because I didn't hear them talking either,  I suspect they had already left. I captured some waypoints, wanting to explore this further with Rich in the future, and turned back to meet him on the trail. We took a nice stroll back toward the car, stopping at hte ledges where we saw some yong people resting and reading. We thought they might have been locals with more information to share, but tehy were students at hte college and not yet too familiar with the area.

"Well, would you like to try Beal's for your lobster roll?" R asked. "If it's too crazy, we can come back to town and have one at Side Street." OK, sounded good to me. He missed the turn onto the "shortcut" in SWH and it's a good thing he did. Heading down Clark Point Road, we turned to look at Red Sky and I was shocked to see the owner, Elizabeth, standing outside on the sidewalk and writing something on a whiteboard. Rich saw a sign that said "Open" and then we saw that the whiteboard said something about Pop-Up Burger Lunch. We had to do it! Pulled into the parking lot for the post office across the street, and headed into the garden (now a newly-created outdoor seating area) behind Red Sky. 

It was lovely, with tables here and there, quite far apart, most under canopies and some more in the open. We were taken to a large table on the upper tier where we could look out over the rest of the garden area, and the grill area down below. Beers came first, of course, and we were happy to find that the draft beer was still available. We got an IPA (Orion) and pilsner. he menu was quite limited, of course: they had a regular beef burger, pulled pork, grilled chicken, and a veggie burger. All came with a delicious potato salad with red pepper and optional bacon, a delicious cole slaw, and a sweet pickle. Also mayo and red pepper sauce. We talked about our morning adventures while sipping our beers and waiting for our food. 

When the food came, everything looked amazing. The only slight problem was that the thick end of R's chicken needed some more time on the grill. He sent it back while we started on the hamburger which was delicious. It came with a thin slice of cheddar and caramelized onions, and along with the pepper sauce it was such a perfect combination. When the chicken sandwich came back, it was cooked and also excellent. I'm not often a fan of grilled chicken sandwiches because they can have aweird texture and bland flavor (or worse, have some kind of fake smoke flavoring) but this had a delicious spice mixture and was served with very fresh tomato and bibb lettuce. We enjoyed the food and atmosphere so much! We were wondering about dessert (not that we needed anything because we were so stuffed) when Elizabeth came over with two freshly baked chocolate chip cookies in little baggies. We shared one and saved the other for later. 

Not quite ready to call it a day, we tried once more (third time at least) to find the benchmark along Pretty Marsh Road that had eluded us in the past. Over the past year, we had checked the datasheet again and found that a local surveyor had found it and updated the coordinates. Finally! We learned that we had been looking in the wrong spot the whole time. We were just one property or so to the east, but that made all the difference. We were probably also confused by the huge boulder we found at that location, somehow convinced the mark had to be on it somewhere, when it wasn't. Today, with the corrected coordinates in hand, we pulled off into a driveway and Rich stayed in the car in case someone came by. I headed into the small patch of woods toward the coordinates. The large boulder was obvious, but what was no obvious was where the mark was! I couldn't believe it, but I walked around the boulder at least 5 times, not seeing anything. A dog was barking at the adjacent house, which also made me anxious (fortunately no one came to investigate, and dog stopped barking after a few minutes). I reread the description and saw that it said the mark was set in a "shoulder" of the boulder about 1.5 feet lower than the top, so I started clearing off an area that matched that description. I scraped off almost an inch of debris (pine needles and dried mud) to finally find the mark! It was so well buried I was actually surprised to find it where I did. Took my photos, including a few from the road showing the nearby powerpole and flagging tape, and we moved on.

We considered looking for the other elusive MDI benchmark, W 144, just off Eagle Lake Road, but the traffic was too crazy and we didn't feel comfortable pulling off the road for long enough to walk to it and search (which, given the condition of the one I had just found, might have taken a while). We did locate a possible parking spot for a future attempt, right in front of the residence identified in the description. 

After all that excitement, we came back to the room for a nice little nap.

Supper tonight was the rest of our treats from this morning: large pecan sticky bun and blueberry Danish, along with a can of Guinness that we picked up from a VERY crowded Hannaford just before having our snacks on the porch. We spent a long time, until it became too chilly to sit there any longer, browsing the old maps on my laptop with today's tracklog overlaid. There were quite a few old roads and trails in the Lake Wood/Fawn Pond area that we would love to check out!
