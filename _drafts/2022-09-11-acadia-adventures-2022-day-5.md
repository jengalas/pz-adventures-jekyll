We were both looking for a light breakfast and found taht A Slice of Eden was open today, so we headed downtown for a quick bite to eat. We were planning to either bring it back to eat on our balcony or go down to the waterfront. Surprisingly, it was dead in town this morning. There wasn't even a line at the bakery; we just walked right up to the counter. I ordered another salt & pepper bagel with olive and pimiento cream cheese; I was still craving it after I had it on Friday. Rich ordered a Western egg & cheese sandwich, which was eggs cooked with green peppers and onions (and Americn cheese) on a croissant. Also got a combo Danish (cheese and raspbery) to try. We ended up taking our food down to the waterfront because it was so quiet in town nd we were already halfway there. The day was slightly hazy/overcast at this point and as a reault a little cooler than it had been earlier in the week. 

It was strange but it really wasn't busy at all in the park or along the water this morning. There was a cruise ship (actually 2, we later discovered) and the buses were lined up to take them away when they arrived on the tenders. So we didn't realy see the cruise passengers either, except later when we were on the Park Loop bus and encountered a huge group of them on the Causeway.

While we ate we discussed what to do today. I suggested a few easy things like checking out the old woods road that appears to run between Park Loop Rd. just east of Sieur de Monts and Main Street just west of JAckson Lab, and I also suggsted maybe investigating the paths I found last year that appear to lead up McFarland and/or Yungs Mountain off of the soutehrn portion of the Breakneck Road. I also briefly mentioned the Redfield Hill trail, not thinking that Rich would want o do that oday, but he was more keen on that than any of the other options for today (we are also interested in Cadillac North Ridge, but that is best saved for a cooler, cloudy day if possible). 

We knew we wanted to take the bus into the park, but on our walk back to our room we decided to drive to the visitors center and get the Park Loop Road bus from there. That would allow us some more flexibility as the bus from te Village Green to the visitors cetner only runs once per hour, and it woudl also save us some walking (to and fron the village green). The visitors cetner parking lot was alreayd filling up, but we had no trouble finding a nice end spot. We only had to wait a few minutes for the Park Loop bus to arrive. We asked the driver when we boarded and he had no problem wit dropping us off at the intersection with Stanley Brook Road. 

The ride around the park loop was uneventuful today, and fortunately it was very quiet on the bus so we were able to enjoy the scenery in peace.  There was a mile-long line of cars near Sand Beach, as usual, ahouthg there idn't appear to be that many people actually on the beach. 

We were let off at the requested spot without any troule and we headed into the carriage road system (note that the carriage roads here are not actually part fo the park but belng to the Land and Garden Preserve; they have different rules and may be marked differently). We hiked westward along the small spur for Stanley Brook Road toward intersection #29, and and from there took a right to go toward the point I had marked as the possible entrance to the Redfield Hill Trail. We soon cmae upon a 4-way intersection with a trail (that I later foud, I think, to be the newly refurbished Seaside Path) and then soon after, a narrow but well-defined path leading southwest. This was about 500 feet east of my apprximate point, but it sure looked like it would be the trail. However we decided to continue on just in case there was something else at the point I had guessed form the map. We din't actually fid anything at that point leading south, but we did spot an obvious old road (blocked by huge deadfall) leading north. Something to investigate anoteher time!

We headed back toward that narrow trail we had foud, and as soon as we began hiknig I ws sure it was the right one. It had the same feel, environment and construction-wise as the Barr Hill trails built and maintained by the same people. There is a soft, springy treadway with lots of conifer needles underfot, and the trail is lined with brihgt green moss and varous lichens. there are two "summits" but overall the trail is rolling hils, very pleasant and peaceful and easy to walk. Some cairns show the way, althuogh there wren't any very tricky sections. One small area of a smooth rock ledge would make for a good picnic or sunbathing spot. 

After we reached this second summmit, it was a quick .14 miles downhill to make the connection with the carriage road and the Barr Hill trail across it. When we reached that intersection, Rich said he needed to pee and went to stand behind a large tree. He called to me a second later, "Hey, guess what?" My first thought was that he had found a tick on himself! My second thought was that he had found either asnake or a survey benchmark. It was neither- in fact, it was a letterbox ("Triple Crown Trio") hidden under a rock at the base of the tree! So cool. It contained a stamp but no book to stamp into (not that I had my letterboxing supplies with me, anyway). 

We finished our hike by walking the carriage roads back to Stanley Brook Rd. When we got there we dsicovered that the Seaside Path runs alongide it, and we need to investigate and map that path in the future. I stopped for a minute to photograph an NPS boundary marker on the carigage road while Rich went back up to the Park Loop Road to wait for the bus. One came aong soon enough (in fact it was the same driver we'd had this morning) but he said the bus was full and we'd have to wait for the next one. We were debating walking the .7 miles up to JPH, figuring that his bus was prbably full due to all the peopel going to JPH on a Sunday afternoon, and that it was likely the next one would be full too. But we waited, and fortunately there were some open seats on the second bus. We made it back to the visitrs center, and then to the room without incident. (We took a quick drive around Hulls Cove to see if we cuold locate Brandan and Monika's new house, but we couldn't find anything other than private drives.)

We were so ready to eat by 5:00pm and were thrilled that we had a reservation at HAvana. We started with mojitos, as always, and enjoyed a litle amuse bouche of shortbread with mascarpone and dried apricot (Rich called it a round Lorna Doone). The bread basket is always delicious but we have to be careful not to fill up on it - it always contains a whoel grain seed bread and a cornbread of some kind (tonight's was blueberry). The spreads were cinnamon butter, chili oil, and black bean spread. All were great! Our appetizer was the usual mushroom spring rolls, always one of the best snacky foods I've ever had (would love to see something like this at Ciao). Then I had the halibut with panko and coconut crust, accompanied by steamed cabbage, spaghetti squash cake, fried kale, and shishito pepper, dressed with blood orange beurre blanc and finished with bruleed lemon and roasted cherry tomatoes. Rich had the chicken roasted with Cubsn marinade and served with lime-basil sauce, beets in balsamic vinaigrette, and forbidden rice with white beans (aso tasted like it had coconut milk), topped with pineapple salsa. Everything was so good! And filing but not overly so, just right. We didn't have room for dessert but had an extra cocktail instead (Havana Martini).

We walked (once we could finally stand up!) back through town slowly, checking out the art gallery along the way (Russell D'Alessio) and particulary enjoying the "Snakelady" piece.
