Breakfast (bagel plate with salad [onions, capers, tomatoes], smoked trout, Earl Grey tea; Eggs Benedict with runny hollandaise sauce, coffee for R.) at Cafe This Way.  Then we checked out the Park Headquarters, which was open today but did not have the _Pathmakers_ book in stock.  We tried the library too, but they were closed.  In the lobby of the motel we picked up a topo map puzzle of the island and worked on it for most of this cold, rainy day.  We didn't really go anywhere else, other than to Jack Russell's at night, where we bought a historic map poster.  For supper we had onion rings, pretzels, crab cakes with asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes; fish & chips for R, and brown ale.  Later on we took a quick drive into town and I couldn't resist the pink grapefruit gelato at the country store.  It was delicious!
