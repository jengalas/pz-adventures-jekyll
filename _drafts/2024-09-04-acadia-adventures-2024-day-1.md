We left the house at 6:15pm. Traffic was very light through PA, not bad at all in NY, and a bit heavy in CT. But the worst part were the four or five construction zones where three lanes merged into one. They took us a long time to get through; we lost at least 45 minutes off our original estimated time. And that was on top of a car fire on the CAsey Highway right at the beginning of our trip that also caused a brief delay. (And don't forget about the wacko that got tired of waiting after 5 minutes and turned around and started to drive back westward in the median. "Must be a Jeep thing," I said. "He won't get far because there's a bridge right back there," R said. Ha!)

We had planned to stop at the only place we could find that was just past halfway and would still be open at that time: the Burger King in Vernon Center, CT. (The deli we used to visit for many years, also in Vernon, closes now at 8pm.) GPS originally estimated that we would arrive at the Burger King at 9:45. It ended up being around 10:25. We got their Whopper Jr. Duo deal, along with a small fries (no salt) and about a dozen ketchup packets. Also coffee to keep R alert (caffeine seems to have no effect on me). We left the Burger King at 11:11, hoping for much lighter traffic, but it wasn't really to be.
