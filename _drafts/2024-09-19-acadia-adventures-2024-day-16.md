Got a relatively early start, got everything packed up and then went for lobster crepes. We drove down and parked at the pier. Note: the kiosks don't require payment until 8:00am, but it was 7:52 when we arrived, and I was able to prepay. We were good until 8:31. Shared a lobster crepe, which was amazing! Delicious lobster salad inside with large chunks of lobster, wrapped in a regular crepe, then a layer of arugula then the whole thing was wrapped in a lattice crepe. 

Checked out and on the road right after 9:00am. Traffic actually wasn't bad at all until we reached I-91 where there was a slowdown, and then a long one on I-691 at the merge point to I-84. There were a few more slowdowns along the way but nothing too crazy. There were even some long stretches on I-95 in Maine where there were almost no other vehicles nearby. Very unusual; most years it's relentless all the way until at least NY or PA. We stopped at the Kennebunk service plaza to pee and get a coffee and ended up getting a cheddar bagel twist at Dunkin. (Decent but messy to eat in the car!) Got home just after 7:00pm, and heated up the small plain pizza for a wonderful welcome-home treat.
