Rich and I decided pretty early this morning to try the Seaside Path, an old but newly refurbished, and mostly new to us, trail that runs from Seal Harbor Beach to the carriage roads just south of Jordan Pond. In order to take the bus to Seal HArbor Beach (so we could hike the trail in one direction and end up at Jordan Pond, not requiring a backtrack) we needed to be at hte village green by 9:15, which meant that we wanted to plan a quick breakfast. We got sandwiches and pastries from Mount Dessert Bakery and brought them back to eat on the porch. Rich got an egg, cheddar cheese, and ham sandwich on a croissant (or more like half a croissant - we're not sure what happened there), dad got egg and cheddar cheese on an everything bagel (was missing the tomato) and I got just a blueberry-cheese-almond danish. We ate on the porch as planned, and had plenty of time to catch the Northeast HArbor bus at 9:15.

The bus was less than half full. My fahter had an interetsing conversation with a man originally from NY but who now lives in BH and was takgin the bus because they were hsting his cousin and wife and figured it would be easier than trying to drive. I guess tehy wre going to Jordan Pond House. They talked a bit about their travels around the US and Canada in their RV. 

There wre a few drive-by stops along the way - this is the first time in the fall that the bus goes to Brown and Parkman mountains, which is good to know. It was apretty quick trip over there, too. The only thing to be aware of is that there are only a few buses on this route each day and they are 2 hours apart. 

We rode through the town of Northeast Harbor, wich dad hasn't really seen before, and then waited for about 10 minutes at the marina before proceeding to Seal Harbor Beach, where we got off and began our hike.

The Seaside path begins a short distance up Seaside LAne, which also requires a short trek west on Route 3 to reach. Once on Seaside Lake, hike north past the Barr Hill trailhead and then the Seaside trailhead appears on the left a short distance later.

This is a newly resurfaced gravel path through moist, mossy pine and spruce? forest. It was by far the most lush trail we've hiked so far this year; everythign else seems quite dry with little moss and fungus to be found. We suspect that the southern end of the trail, at least, receives significant mornign fog from the harbor, and the thick tree and ground cover locks it in. 

All along the way, we spotted and I photographed old R/US boundary markers following the boundary between park land and the old Rockefeller property (now mostly under the auspices of the Land and Garden Preserve). It was so cool to hike this new-to-us trail along wit this added level of excitement! I also spotted a white coral? fungus in the woods in the distance but it was in a very brushy area down a steep grade and we didn't see a safe way to approach it. Tis will be a great area for photography on a foggy or misty day, so maybe we can try again on a day like that.

We hiked the trail all the way to the cariage road just south of Jordan Pond House. I spotted an unmarked but well-worn path alng the way and ran it (while dad was waitin gon the Seaside Path and getting devoured by mosquitoes - oops!) to see where it went. the first part of teh path was just ashortcut to the nearest carriage road, but then right across the way was the trail to Redfield Hill that we hiked on Sunday! I ran up a litle way just to make sure it met up with our previous tracklog.

The best part was that we didn't see anyone at all on the trail until very near the end, when one couple and a huge bear-like dog passed us by quickly. 

The area around JPH was crazy, as expected. We had no trouble getting a bus from there back tot he visitors center, but then had to wait almost an hour for the bus back tot eh village green. On the bus from JPH we talked with a woman who had been a driver for the Island Explorer this season and had finished up on Monday. She was heading back the next day to her new home beng built in North Carolina. She raved about the job and said it was absolutely phenomenal and so much fun. We were trying to get dad to sign up as a driver for next year!

Rather than going back to the room and then back into town, we decided (as we di 5 years ago or so) to just go directly for a late lunch/early supper at Paddy's. We stopped at a two of the "Acadia shops" along the way to look for the blueberry-mango jam that Elaine liked so much. I didn't see it, but I did find a few others that she might like (blueberry marmalade and blueberry-lime-ginger) in addition to her usual wild blueberry jam that I get for her every year.

Paddy's wasn't too busy around 3:00pm, and we were able to get one of our usual tables near the window. We started with some beers (of course, Guinness for me and R ["Biden says you're not really Irish if you don't like Guinness!"]) and Haze Forward IPA for dad). I was torn between the pub burger and fish tacos. While I was in the mood for a taste of a burger, I knew the whole thing would just be too much. So I went for the fish tacos, which were very good. Fried cod topped with corn salsa (with jalapenos, red peppers, onions), and srirachi aioli, and avocado and lime wedge in corn tortilla. Very good and relatively light. Rich got the Wexford fish sandwich minus the bun, and dad got the fish sandwich with the bun, a large seeded roll. Both sandwiches came with pickes, and we all got coleslaw instead of fries. It was peacful sitting there in a relatively quiet restaurant, hearing stories of R's and dad's days n the military. I shouldn't have, but I ordered a blueberry pie for dessert. I've had it before and I know it's pretty small, basically a mini-pie, served with a small dollop of lemon curd and whipped cream, some fresh fruit, and a small scoop of vqnilla ice cream. Unfortunately we forgot to take a photo before we all dove in!
