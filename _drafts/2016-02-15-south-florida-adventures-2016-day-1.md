Fight to CLT canceled yesterday afternoon. We were somehow able to rebook for am earlier flight through Philly. Up early 3am, dad picked us up 4:45. Hoping we could get out before the storm reached us. Wasn't looking too good when many people showed up for the first flight from Avp. Then they announced that it was oversold (duh) so we were nervous hoping we wouldn't get kicked off. Then they said they had enough seats but to much weight.  Hilarious when they started to offer $500 to people to volunteer to go to a later flight and the only one who moved was a midget! He wasn't volunteering, just going to the restroom, but the irony was hilarious. I dint know how it was resolved because we didn't see anyone come forward, but we soon boarded the plane. Then we waited and waited, and heard the dreaded words that there was a maintenance issue and they had to shut down all of the systems in the plane to troubleshoot. I guess all it required was a reboot because in 10 minutes or so we were on our way in a Dash 8 that felt and sounded a little like a B2 bomber on takeoff.

We reached Philly without further delay and had just the right amount of time to catch the shuttle and get to the gate and use the bathroom before boarding. It was supposedly 28 degrees in Philly, about 20 degrees warmer than it was at home, but it sure didn't feel any warmer!

3 hour flight to Miami was as you would expect, cramped and full of annoying and hacking and farting people. One woman was exceedingly annoying. But we survived somehow and arrived in Miami over 2 hours before our originally scheduled flight. Got baggage and got a blue cab immediately for ride to rental car place. No problem there except that instead of a nice new Volkswagen Jetta like last time, today we got stuck with a crappy Chevy Cruze with a hole over the left taillight and a filthy interior and an empty gas tank (for which inconvenience, at least, we supposedly get a 7% discount).

Our stop along  the way to Homestead was at Isaac Farms, a huge cactus nursery! I was in utter heaven and Rich wasn't far behind. They had acres and acres of every kind of cactus you can imagine. We spent well over an hour there and still didn't get to see everything, and didn't get to buy anything. We might have a chance to find a box to carry them in and possibly pick up a few before heading home. Unbelievable place!

Next we checked in at the Hotel Redland and went a block up the road for very much needed food and drink at Casita Tejas. Negro Modelo which was greatly appreciated, great chips and salsa, tacos al pastor with pork and pineapples and spinach enchiladas (1 chicken 1 beef 1 cheese filled with delicious spinach sauce, almost like pesto). Came back and collapsed!
