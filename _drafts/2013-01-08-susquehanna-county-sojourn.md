My father's eyes lit up when we began talking about Susquehanna County tri-stations over chicken fondue last weekend. Was he interested in the stations themselves? Well, maybe not really, but he was certainly interested in any excuse to have breakfast at Bingham's. He was intrigued by the fact that he recognized the property owners' names in the two marks we wanted to scout out, however.

Breakfast; told him about LENOX on the hill nearby and the adventures we had there.
Then began drive toward the first mark. Saw Acre Lake (pond) and heard about the general store (which appears to still be in existence) where they would stop on their way to school when they took the car to buy tobacco.

Then drove up Bennett Road just to see if any of the old names were on the mailboxes. They weren't and my father didn't recognize anyone. We saw a flock of sheep ("It's just those damned city folk stopping to look at the sheep... go back to bed") and turned around after less than a mile. Lots of evidence of gas drillers around.

Came down the insanely steep hill past Frank McAloon's old house, whom I'd always heard about but never met. Remember goofy things my grandmother used to say about him, about the money rolling down the hill and how they sat up on the hill looking down on everyone.

Then reached Loomis Lake, where we heard about swimming and fishing, and how it looked a lot smaller than when he was young. We intended to try driving around the lake, but the upper entrance to the road was chained off, with a funny, tiny dangling hand lettered wooden sign that said "LOCKED" even though there was nothing resembling a gate or lock to be found. Rich got a real kick out of this.

First mark: could possibly be behind small pond, down on the hill where we couldn't see the boulder. This belongs to Smiths, who had 19 kids in a tiny little house. Had stools, grill "for grilling hot dogs", etc. set up for ice fishing alongside the little pond.

Went past the farm; seems to still be in good shape. Old barn is well over 100 years old, "new" part added in 1952. Saw ice house, truck garage, horse barn, car garage, outhouse!, and storage building. My father pointed out his old bedroom, on the left on the second floor of the house. Drove by Uncle John's without saying much. I reminded Dad of "Billy Daniels Sing's" cassette and he remembered "YES! YES! YES!" so funny. He thought we should stop and ask if they have any left. "Why yes, we have almost a full case!" Needless to say we didn't stop.

Circled around and drove through Hop Bottom, more active than Montdale, which isn't saying anything for Montdale. Drove up to the trolley station that Rich and I visited a few years ago; my father knew the Rivenburgs. Heard about the feed mill to the north of town. Then back up the hill through the tunnel, past the farm again and out toward the second mark. Heard about the other 100 acres that they owned for a while, and how they had to drive ("like a cattle drive!") the heifers down there, and then bring them back home. Reached the supposed McAloon property; my father knew the old owners (Francioni, or something like that). New house built next door but they area of the station didn't seem to be disturbed. A part of the stone was even free of snow, but although I got out and peeked, I couldn't see a mark. I wouldn't doubt that its on that stone or another one nearby, but we'll have to wait till the snow melts to know for sure.
