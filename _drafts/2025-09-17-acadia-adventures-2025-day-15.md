Having done nearly everything on my list of suggestions for this year (The easy stuff, of course, because we were looking to have a relaxing time overall) we weren't sure what to investigate today, our last day on the island. We considered maybe checking out the causeway, but we also wanted to drive the portion of the Park Loop Road that borders the ocean - a tradition that we haven't yet done this year, for some reason.

So we decided to combine that drive with a hike along part of the Quarry Trail in Otter Creek. We could also check out the Otter Creek Landing, where there is supposed to be a nice waterfall in wetter years. We didn't expect much this year, but at least it's something new that we haven't investigated before.

We've never seen the Park Loop Road as busy as it was this morning. It was just 10:00am when we passed the Precipice parking area, and not only was the lot full (not surprising) but the right lane of the road was completely full for the better part of a mile. It looked as crazy as the area around Sand Beach usually does.

And of course Sand Beach was completely crazy too. In fact there wasn't a single open parking spot anywhere along the right lane until we neared Otter Cliffs. Completely nuts! And of course, the huge cruise ship in the harbor doesn't at all account for the vehicles driving around. It probably did have some impact on the thousands of people walking the Ocean Path this morning, though. 

If you could ignore the hordes, it was still a beautiful mostly sunny morning with a light haze over the ocean and Egg Rock visible. And once we passed OTter Cliffs, we mostly had the place to ourselves. We passed through Fabbri and made our way out to Route 3 via Otter Creek Road, discussing the Green & White path and the Green & Black path (which Matt Marchon has found, and which I think I located a few years ago but didn't follow the whole way to the Bowl). 

The map is a bit confusing in the area of the Otter Creek Landing, and our first attempt to reach it via Gray Road was a bust - the road just peters out into essentially someone's driveway. You can tell that the road once passed through, as the map indicates, but now it is likely not driveable and there probably isn't anywhere to turn around if you give it a try and find that you're in too deep. Nothing said we couldn't walk down that road, but there was nowhere to park that wasn't clearly on someone's property.

So we went back on Route 3 and instead accessed the area via Grove Road. We found a convenient parking pulloff just next to the landing, and then hiked down to look for the waterfall.

We were about halfway to the dock when I saw movement, and then a striped body flash across and off the trail, going over a bank. A snake!!! _Finally._ This beautiful maritime garter snake was the first one we've seen here all year. We quietly peeked over the bank to see if we could spot him, and then we saw more movement in the weeds, just off the road. It was a snake - but could it have been the same snake, or a second one? We were pretty sure the first one has slipped right over the edge and down the steep bank, so this may indeed have been a different one.  Too bad they were too quick for us, and we weren't able to get a photo.

Now down at the dock, we spotted the little trickle where the waterfall would typically be. Rich said that according to Marchon, the entire ledge would have water falling over it in a typical year, but now it was nearly dry. It was still a neat spot to check out. 

While we were there, I happened to look to my left and I spotted a granite post with an NPS boundary marker disk on top. Cool! Then I looked to the south and I saw another one ... and then another! It seemed strange that there were three in such close proximity. I documented all of them.

On our way back up the road, I was keeping an eye out for snakes, figuring that we'd left the area for long enough that they might have felt it safe to come out into the sun and bask again. And wouldn't you know it, there was a maritime garter snake on the roadside, periscoping up high! Rich was able to take one photo (too bad he only had a 40mm lens) before the snake turned and slithered off smoothly.

After that excitement, we were ready to check out the Quarry Trail. This required a steep but short hike up the road from the landing. Entering the trail on the wooden board set across the sharp rocks in the ditch, I could tell we were in for a peaceful walk. Just didn't feel like the kind of place we would see too many people.

The trail was a little more challenging that we expected, but in an interesting way. There are no big elevation gains, no high rock steps, just rolling hills and lots of roots and rock underfoot. A typical Acadian woodland path. The aroma of pine and balsam was all around us, as were many precocious red squirrels chirping and running around and chewing on cones.

We followed the path down to the Otter Creek causeway, where we took a few photos surrounded by the peacefulness of the ocean (and still lots of cars, but at least they weren't too loud). Then we took a long slow walk back up the trail and then down the steep hill to the car. 

All the while I was trying to figure out what quarry the trail name refers to. That will take some more research.

We weren't planning on having anything for lunch, but I had the heel of the focaccia left, along with some goat cheese, and we were looking for a place to sit and eat it. 

As we drove up to the Otter Creek Market, we decided to stop and check it out, just because we've never been inside before. It wasn't too exciting; they had mostly gas station/convenience store items, and it looked like they sold lobster rolls, hot dogs, and hamburgers. It is definitely "rustic." The whole time I kept thinking about the League of Gentlemen: "This is a _local_ shop for _local_ people!"

At this point we figured we would just go to the marina at Northeast Harbor to sit at the picnic tables and have a snack, and while we were there, might as well just get a lobster quesadilla from the Bucking Lobster to share. Can't really pass up the opportunity!  

It turned cloudy and cool this afternoon, and particularly breezy when we first arrived at the marina. Rich ordered and waited close to the food truck for our quesadilla (plus the side order of fries with no salt) while I claimed a picnic table. By the time he brought the food over to the table, the breeze had mostly subsided, so we didn't have to chase napkins all over the place as we've had to in the past, and it was feeling a bit warmer and more pleasant for our snack. I had eaten the bread and some of the goat cheese while waiting for Rich to return with the food, but I still had plenty of appetite left for a bit of quesadilla and fries. Everything was hot, fresh, and delicious, with lobster juice and melted cheese running down my fingers as I ate. The lime-garlic aioli was a particularly good match for the flavors of the quesadilla, and the fresh salsa here is always excellent.

We were walking back to the car when we spotted an antique light blue Chevrolet pickup truck backing out of its parking spot and driving away from the marina.

We headed out too, and made our way back to Bar Harbor via Eagle Lake Road, so we could avoid the very long temporary traffic light on Route 3. Just about to turn onto Cottage Street and we noticed the blue Chevy truck also turning onto Cottage Street just ahead of us. We went to the gas station to fill up for tomorrow, and then made our way back to the room. We were arranging some items in the back of the car when the blue Chevy truck passed by on Holland Avenue! Pretty amusing. 

It was already getting close to 2:00pm, and of course we wanted to be ready and waiting at Rosalie's door when it opened. We spent the afternoon watching a few videos, reading, and researching, and then made our way down for pizza, arriving by 3:45 to find a group of three people already standing at the door. 

"Uncle Jimmy" was a friendly, jocular guy who was chatting up some young lady he knew who apparently had been passing by on the sidewalk, and he joked that he wouldn't let us cut in line and would fight us to get in the door. His poor wife wasn't feeling well and needed to sit down; fortunately by that point we only had a few minutes to wait before the door opened, and they made their way to the first booth downstairs, which was their favorite (and used to be our favorite, until we discovered that it's usually much less busy and somewhat quieter upstairs). 

Meanwhile I made my way upstairs, and claimed our usual booth, and went back down to help Rich bring up the beers. Our small house veggie pizza arrived a few minutes later, while we were reviewing the half marathon route on the map and noting that I've already run more than half of the course - just not at one time. We weren't even terribly hungry, but the pizza was amazing and so full of veggies, we ate the whole thing and savored every bite.

When we were nearly done eating, Rich placed the order for three small pizzas to take home with us. We decided to get a sausage and another house veggie for ourselves, and a plain cheese pizza for dad. I know I won't be able to get it to him until Friday, but hopefully it will still be good if he reheats it in the oven.

Ice cream wasn't on the menu for tonight. We were just too full. But we fully enjoyed our last evening walk through town, cutting through the side yard of the church and up to Mount Desert Street, me balancing three pizza boxes and Rich keeping pace easily even with sore legs. As always, we're a bit physically worn out but spiritually renewed - the best kind of vacation!
