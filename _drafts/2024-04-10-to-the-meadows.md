Sometimes opportunities come out of nowhere, and


Flights on time, and everythig went more smoothly than I cold have hoped. Initially nervous about a 49-minute connection at O'Hare (I think we've all been traumatized in some way by O'Hare, not to mention the horror stories brougth home by my travel-agent mother about missed connections) But it worked out perfectly. We were both traveling carrryon-only, which I've never done before and I was anxious that it would take some time to retreve my bag from the overhead compartment and exit the plane with enoght time to spare to get to teh second gate and get on the connecting flight. All the worry was for nothing. Not only did I have no such trouble, but I didn't even have to use the overhead compartment. I wa assured several times by the gate attendant that my bag (which to me felt like a huge backpack) did not need to be gate-checked and in fact would fit underneath the seat (along with my laptop case). I was highly doubtful, but he was right.  Both bags slid easily underneath the seat and I even still had room for my feet. We exited the plane without much delay, walked to the nearby gate for the connecting flight, and boarded within a few minutes.

Both flights were full and people were well behaved on both. Both times we were offered the infamous Biscoff cookies and mini-pretzels, along with a drink. I declined the drink in both cases, and took pretzels and Biscoffs for later (really the Biscoffs were just to bring home to Rich as a bit of a joke). I wore a mask while flying, and preferred to keep it on as much as possible. I thorougly enjoyed reading "The Hobbit" while we were on our way.  

The first sight that greeted us at the Las Vegas airport was ... 3 guesses? You'll only need one. Slot machines, of course. It certainly set the tone for the area immediately, as did the "Liquor Library" we spotted on our way out. I was, of course, much more interested in the large concrete sculpture of a horned lizard near the base of the arrival terminal escalator.
