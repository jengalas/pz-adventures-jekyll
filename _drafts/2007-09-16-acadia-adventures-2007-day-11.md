Breakfast at Jeannie's - 3 pancakes, bacon(R); strawberry pancakes, coffee, apple juice.  Rode from Parkman Mtn parking to Jordan Pond, then up to Day Mtn Summit.  Rested for a while in the sun, played around taking photos on the way back down.  Long ride back (we are wimps, I guess!) Back to room.  Burning Tree for supper: clam angel hair pasta, seafood fritters with spicy aioli; lavender roasted chicken breast, potatoes, vegetables; monkfish with oyster mushrooms, mashed potatoes,  peas and shallots (R); yellow beet salad with yogurt and dill sauce; lemon curd and blueberry tart; cadillac Mtn Stout and Thunder Hole Ale.  Went to Thunder Hole at night!!!! Episode with car in our parking spot when we returned to the hotel.
