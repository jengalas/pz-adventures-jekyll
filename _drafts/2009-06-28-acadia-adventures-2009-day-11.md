Breakfast was sticky buns, Earl Grey tea and coffee from Morning Glory.  Supper was bread, cheese plate (parmesan, Seal Cove goat cheese, 4 year aged cheddar, and an orange rind cheese that we can't remember the name of from Colorado, dried cherries and apricots, homemade crackers), panko-crusted halibut, sesame soba noodles, cucumber and red onion salad with black sesame seeds, Flying dog In Heat Wheat, no room for dessert at Red Sky.
