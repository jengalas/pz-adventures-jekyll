Began with breakfast, the last remaining sticky bun from Bob's Bunz, at the beach by the tiki. 

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery1" class="" %}

Then r went back to the room to finish packing up and i went back to the open area where we find the sponges yesterday.I wanted to see if o could find more and I did find a couple more including a very large one right at the corner.I also found several corals, one the honeycomb type and several that were red/coral colored. We finished packing up and checked out, and then began our leisurely drive north.

Along the way to Bahia Honda we stopped at several fishing piers and found mucho benchmarks on them. At one point we spotted one at the corner of a wingwall/seawall and took a small dry gravelly trail down toward the water to see it up close. We saw a bike propped up against a tree but I didn't notice anyone nearby. I took a few closeups the mark and was moving around to take My area views when I heard Rich taking to someone.I looked into the wooded hammock and saw, well,a guy on a hammock strung between two trees. He was just hangin' out chilling by the water,I guess. He made a few comments about how the fishing was good there, how he had seen minnows in the water and how there are sharks in the area.

We had s great time next at Bahia Honda. We went to the northern part of the park and hiked the Silver Palm trail, a beautiful nature trail through the hammock and our to the beach. We saw sea lavender, butterflies, the three different kinds of mangroves (prop roots-red! Snorkel roots-black! No roots-white?!) Sea grapes everywhere, sea oats. We emerged onto the beach in full sun, soft white sand and chilly water(but still 20 degrees warmer than in Maine!). I was playing in the water and Rich was taking photos when a surfer dude approached him. I couldn't hear what he was saying but Rich called me over and pointed to  a puffy transparent blue object. "Portuguese man o war," he said. They're washing up on the beach today. The guy he was talking to said he was attacked so badly while surfing that he ended up on the hospital. At that point I remembered the same thing happening to Kathy in Hawaii on her honeymoon. We steed clear of then for the rest of our walk there! Wet did find a just-washed-up live one, as opposed to the many that were fried on the sun already. The live one was really cool and freaky.

We spent some more time wandering the beach and then, after cleaning up at the foot showers, drove to the other end of the park. We were curious about the Bahia Honda bridge having heard that the section you can walk out on was closed. We enjoyed the walk through the woods and sea grapes past the "amplitudium" and found that we could go about halfway across the part of the bridge that remains. Supposedly the part over the water was closed by FlDot, like the ramp to Pigeon Key, for unsafe conditions.

We were getting hungry and decided to try the diner that Dave had been recommending for years, the Cracked Conch.It was ok but nothing great. We had the Conch balls which were like very large conch fritters, a little too light on the conch and heavy on the fritter; a mahi melt on rye with white cheese and mushrooms which was quite good, and onion rings. Iced teas to drink. Afterward we did some shopping at the office max, Walgreens and Publix nearby. We were mainly looking for some kind of container to use to transport the cactuses home. We think we found a few things that will work.

Our final adventure for the day was to explore the Crane Point area. Wow, this was great! You can take a trolley tour but we  opted to walk the whole trail system. Cool spots were the Adderley house, built in the early 1900s by George and Olivia adderley Pioneer settlers from the Bahamas. The house was well constructed of tabby. George was a sponger and also preached and made charcoal for sale. The conservation group is on the process of restoring the house. Another great trail was the Bahamas trail, a wild trek through dense palm and mangrove canopy,complete with cactus everywhere, acanthocereus and Dragon fruit! Really gorgeous. Pretty cool spots were the Crane house,a 50s time capsule in almost af l Wright style, but pink and light green, the Point, and the Sunset boardwalk.

We called the ragged edge to make sure someone would be around when wet arrived. Despite being told we'd have to do 10 jumping jacks to identify ourselves, everything went smoothly and we wet soon settled into our room street a brief talk with the owner. A few minutes later we headed to Jersey Boardwalk pizza for a tasty tin crust pie made better with the addition of some oregano, and a big pitcher of Fat Tire Ale.
