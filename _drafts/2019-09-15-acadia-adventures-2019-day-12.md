This was a day full of varied and unusual adventures! We had plans to meet Angie around 10:30 at the Eagle Lake Bridge. Our time was a bit restricted because we wanted to go to the farmers market this morning and make sure we had plenty of time to do that, and Angie had a dance class beginning at 12:30 in Town Hill. Unfortunately this was the only chance we had to squeeze in a little time to meet.

We had our breakfast at the very busy Slice of Eden Cafe on the way to the market. We enjoyed two bagels while we were there (salt & pepper with spicy lime and cilantro cream cheese for me; caramelized onion with veggie cream cheese for R). We also bought two small pecan sticky buns and a feta and broccoli croissant for trail snacks later.

Then we went to the market. It was as colorful and tasty as ever! I first bought some husk cherries after tasting one that someone had offered me. I had never heard of them before but wow, they are amazing! They are like a tiny sweet tomatillo - maybe similar to a gooseberry but not as tart, just very sweet with a slight vegetal taste at the end. While I waited in line to buy these, Rich bought some sausages for our neighbor. Then we headed straight for the goat cheese! I bought one of my usual favorites, the fig and kalamata olive from Yellow Birch Farm, and then we bought a selection of four from Sunset Acres (garlic and dill, Parisienne, lemon thyme and cranberry orange). On the way out I picked up a few packs of granola.

After a few minutes arranging things back at the room, we headed out toward the Eagle Lake carriage road to meet Angie. She arrived a few minutes after we got to the bridge, excited to share with us her discovery from this morning of quarry ledges just north of the road by the carriage road parking area. We dove into the woods and found the ledges easily - they were so cool! Drill holes were evident from the quarrying operations. This would be a great place for a picnic! (Although close to the road, at least it's easily accessible and is a large, open, sunny spot on a nice day.) It's also easy to get to since, well, it's close to the road. 

We then continued on further to see another quarry site and dumping spot with lots of old trash including bottles, buckets, even pieces of old shoes. Pretty amazing! Clearly there was an old road into this site as well. And we came down to the Eagle Lake inlet where we found some discarded pieces of a wood stove. We chatted for a few more minutes before it was time for Angie to head out, and then Rich and I poked around for a little longer, taking some photos of the sundews we had noticed on the way in, before making our way back to the car as well.

Our next stop was the stone barn. I had heard about this site a few years ago, but we never came to check it out until now. I thought it would be perfect to explore since we've been enjoying so much native plant photography recently. 

There's a small path leading from the parking area through a short section of woods and over a small wooden bridge, and then the trail emerges onto a meadow with a wide, mowed path cutting up through the meadow and ultimately into the woods at the northwestern edge.  We followed this slowly, taking photos along the way of anything that seemed interesting and anything that would allow, given the breezes that moved the higher-growing and more dainty plants. 

Continuing northwesterly we entered a pine forest where a path went straight and another led to the right. We figured the one to the right would take us around the meadow, and wanted to return that way, so we first checked out the path leading straight. The cool woods gave our skin a nice break from the harsh sun and we found some interesting mushrooms here, as well as the old gnarly pines growing close together. We plan to come back and finish this trail to see where it leads - I assume to the creek? 

Backtracking to the other trail we followed it just inside the edge of the woods until it reemerged in the meadow. The trail at first was just a narrow path, nothign like the wide mowed path we had walked on the other side of the meadow, so we weren't (still aren't) sure we were on the correct trail, but soon it joined another mowed path that took us back toward the barn. Such a different site and one worth more exploration, perhaps at sunrise or sunset? THere was some kind of painting class or workshop taking place near the barn and pond when we returned to the car (where we were blocked in, but we were able to get around). 

Dinner at Red Sky was amazing as always. We got the nice round corner table, and aside from afew people at the bar and a special party (apparently) in that area, we basically had the place to ourselves at firs.t Then it began to fill up, but slowly and nothign like Thursday night. We started with the lobster tostada and Great Hill blue cheese salad, and then had the chicken and duck (with wild blueberry compote!) and au gratin potatoes. I helped R out with his kale since he isn't a fan. We also had three martinis between us (since the first two were skimpy) andhad just enough room left for dessert - deep dark bittersweet chocolate pudding with whipped cream and a vanilla cookie. So good! Our ride back took us through the park (traditional for one of our last evenings) where we saw 2 deer, checked out Thunder Hole (the walkway is currentyl closed for repais, although we couldn't tell what needed or was being repaired) and watched a nearly full deep orange moon beneath eerie gray clouds.
