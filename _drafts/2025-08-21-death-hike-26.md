Easy early morning drive to Monks' townhouse, no benchmark hunts along the way. No roadwork or really any crazy traffic along the way, other than a few super fast drivers that came out of nowhere, passing people on the shoulder (which is typical anymore). Arrived there just after 7:30. Had the amazing eggs with mushrooms and ricotta, then did the car swap so we could get the car they wanted to take out of the garage, park the other car in the garage, and then leave mine in the driveway.
