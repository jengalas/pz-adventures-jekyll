Easy early morning drive to Monks' townhouse, no benchmark hunts along the way. No roadwork or really any crazy traffic along the way, other than a few super fast drivers that came out of nowhere, passing people on the shoulder (which is typical anymore). Arrived there just after 7:30. Had Gina's amazing eggs with mushrooms and ricotta, then did the car swap so we could get the car they wanted to take out of the garage, park the other car in the garage, and then leave mine in the driveway.

We reached the parking area at Mt. Tammany after just a slightly confusing trip around the area since it is confusing where you're actually supposed to get off the highway. We first ended up at a slightly different parking area for the Red Dot Trail that probably would have been OK because a trail connects through to the Appalachian Trail parking area, but understandably we were concerned about Alan and whether he would be able to find us. (Not that he's ever had a problem with parking in the wrong place before! :grin:)
