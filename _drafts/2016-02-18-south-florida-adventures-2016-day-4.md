Standard breakfast of fruit and bagels (we were the first to arrive so had all the food to ourselves) at Redland was followed by packing up and checking out. We asked the housekeeper if she might have a box that would fit our cactuses and she had one that was nearly perfect. We still will look for something with a lid but for carrying them around in the car this will be perfect.

Soon we were on our way toward the keys, taking the route we accidentally took yesterday. Our first stop was at Windley Key fossil reef geological park, which we had been interested in last time but its days of operation didn't coincide with the days of our visit. We arrived right at 10am but discovered that the tours, while given at 10 and 2, are only given on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. We were still able to do a great self guided tour which might have worked out even better since we spent lots of time taking photos, as usual. We saw three quarry sites that were originally used to quarry the local limestone/coral for fill when Flagler was building the railroad. Afterward the rock was quarried for decorative stone because it's structurally unsound and can't be used for building. We bought a cube of it at the visitor center. We saw so many trees along the trail that we were able to identify due to the detailed field guide that we obtained from the ranger. the first was poisonwood,  which it is wise to learn to identify since most people react to it similarly to poison ivy. Some people even get a reaction if they stand under it during a rain storm. We then encountered, as we walked, black, white and red ironwood, mangroves, mahogany, blolly, wild dilly, and many more. One of my favorite spots was the old Quarry railroad station, of which only a platform and water tank cradles are left.  One highlight for us were all the cactus along the trails! We didn't expect them at all. The first ones we came across were at the highest elevation in the park, along the Windley Trail. I suspected that they were the key tree cactus (pilosocereus robinii) but wasn't sure. Then we came across harrisia and acanthocereus on the trail as well. According to the guide there was supposed to be prickly pear as well but we couldn't find it. We came out of the hammock into the Windley Quarry where we saw more high cut limestone walls and quarry machinery. This would be a great spot for a picnic! I asked the ranger about the cacti that were tagged and numbered. He confirmed that they were the tree cacti and said that this batch had been transplanted there 9 months ago by a conservation group from, I think, Big Pine Key. They wanted to see how well they would do in this environment so they are tracking their progress. The ranger mentioned as we had noticed that the ones that had rotted seemed to be those closer to the trail. He wondered if it was something he was doing! My thoughts were unless you're peeing on them or spraying them with herbicide, I doubt it! Maybe they are just getting more sunlight in those areas or suffered some root damage from bring closer to the trail. Also he said that the prickly pears keep moving around and that they never stay where they post the numbered signs. It was a great visit!

Our next quick stop was at Bob's Bunz, where we did grab our bunz on the way out: 2 full size sticky buns, a mini key lime bundt cake and an apple blossom, which we ate immediately. It was like a cross between apple pie and apple strudel, filled with apples and very delicious.  We saved the others for later.

Lunch was at Brutus, one of our favorite stops from 2 years ago. They've fixed up the outside seating a lot, now there are more tables and it's underneath a thatch roof. Lunch was add fabulous add wet expected! We shared a shrimp melt sandwich (KW pink shrimp salad,  pepper jack cheese, spinach on toasted Multigrain bread) and shrimp po boy (pink shrimp, artichokes, shredded cabbage with cilantro lime garlic sauce on a sub roll), potato salad and black beans salad and french fries. Had beers, Islamorada citrus ale and wheat beer.

We next headed toward our next stop at Sugarloaf Lodge, but along the way we noticed the western end of the old 7 mile bridge which, like the eastern part but not the middle hag been restored. It's now primarily used as a fishing pier. As we approached I spotted a large iguana down by the boat ramp. It might be one of the invasive iguanas but I'm not sure. We followed it through the grass and then saw 2 more, a medium size green one and a small black one-possibly a family? Then wet hit the benchmark bonanza on the bridge. We found 4 at the end of the bridge, 2 within a foot of each other.  We walked a bit and spotted birds on the rail and many skates in the water. A great side trip that I wasn't expecting at all!

We arrived at Sugarloaf a little before 5. Checked in with no problem. Great large clean room overlooking the bay. Noise from some HOA party at the tiki bar but otherwise ok. We had a small pizza as a snack from the pizza shop on the property. It was ok but not great.
