No sleep, early morning at the airport, waiting at Detroit forever (long walk, wild tunnel and neverending fire alarm!), flight gate and time changed then mechanical issue.  Finally got to Phoenix about an hour late and figured out how to get the rental car.  We drove north through an awful storm.  Montezuma Castle was already closed, took photos at Bell Rock in the insane wind!  Tried the Oak Creek Brewery for supper.

Food: subsisted in the morning on leftover pizza and porketta sandwich from the Waymart Hotel, water, Lifesavers, tomato juice.  No Havarti-type flavor cheese food on this plane!  Oak Creek Brewery and Grill: Thick-cut beer batter onion rings (awesome!!!), brew pub pretzels, BBQ ribs; Horseshoe Hefeweisen and Oak Creek Amber Ale, Village Nut Brown Ale.
