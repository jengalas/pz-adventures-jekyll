Taking the back route appealed to me so much, and it would be the first time in the history of the Death Hike (with the exception of the two virtual Death Hikes in 2020 and 2021) that I wouldn't be taking I-81. 

While I hate that highway as much as anyone in this area, I admit there was a sense of excitement that built every Death Hike morning as I which I had nearly to myself so early in the morning.  And then the drive home down the long grade past Mountain Top, looking into the valley ahead, in early evening—the weather was always beautiful at that time of day, regardless of what kind of weather we had during the hike—somehow signified a shift into the summer season.  

There was another treat that I would be missing out on this year. For the past few years (well, since Ken and Gina moved to their new home) I have been invited over for breakfast on Death Hike morning. It means arriving extra-early, but it also means fabulously delicious scrambled eggs made with mushrooms, spinach, and romano cheese. Gina loads up the plate with a huge portion of the scramble, and serves it with buttered English muffins.

Nevertheless, I decided that I would take the back route from home and search for a few benchmarks along the way. 

As it turned out, Ken emailed me the night before the hike to say that Gina was ill and would not be joining us for the hike. This was a real shame, because until now, the three of us had participated in every Death Hike! I felt really bad that she had to miss the day's activities.

I woke up early and left the house before 7:00am, as planned. It was a calm, clear, chilly (37°F) morning, the type of day that warms up quickly in the strong May sunshine. 

I had about 2½ hours to search for benchmarks along my route before I was expected to arrive at the Ricketts Glen parking lot. This sounds like a lot of time, but it really isn't. I only had time to search briefly for seven of the marks on my list, and I didn't find any of them. (I found a few marks, but they were resets or otherwise different from the marks I had targeted.) 

In one case (44 CH), I found a very high, prominent ledge that looked like a perfect spot for a bench mark, and it fit the description well. But the ledge was covered with a thick layer of accumulated soil, moss,and other debris. It's probably an impossible task without a lot of time and a metal detector. But sometime we may come back with both, and try again!

One real bummer was a mark that had been set in an old schoolhouse yard (45 CH). While I had no expectation that the schoolhouse would still be there (it wasn't), I was hoping that the mark would be present. The area was open and easy enough to walk around in, but I could find no sign of the mark or even the rock ledge that it had been set into.

Another hour to search for survey marks would have been great, but it was after 9:00am already and I wanted to arrive early at the parking area. It was the first nice-weather Saturday we've had all year, and I was afraid the lot would already be full!

Not to worry (it's not a National Park, and it is kinda in the middle of nowhere, I realize). The lot was still nearly empty when I arrived at 9:15. One of our die-hards from previous years—Alan—was already there and waiting, having driven three hours from southern New Jersey for the hike. (I thought **I** was dedicated!)

Alan and I chatted for a few minutes and snacked on some brownies I had brought (my favorite "better than box mix recipe," in case you were wondering). Within ten minutes, Ken appeared. With both "leaders" present, the day's activities were officially under way!

It took only a few more minutes for another vehicle to arrive. This group of four students (Mike, Shaaf, Jacob, and Anthony) were the only others who joined us today. We waited until just after 10:00am just in case, but apparently no one else was up for the challenge today.
