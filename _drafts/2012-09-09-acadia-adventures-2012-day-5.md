Artichoke pockets, documented TIDAL D by the Shore Path.  Bike ride around Eagle Lake.  Heard from Dave, who had just arrived late the night before, while we were on our ride.    Cloudy and very cool day. Lots of good conversation while we rode.

Took a short trip to the Wild Gardens in the afternoon.  Decided on Havana for supper; walked around SWH while we waited because we arrived early.  The wine and cheese shop was closed but we checked out Cafe Dry Dock, which looked pretty good, and Sawyer's Specialties across the street.  Remember to look for interesting green tea with Thai flavors!  We bought some interesting pasta sauces we can't get at home.  Dinner was awesome.  R had the pasta dish, which we would normally never get but it sounded good.  It was indescribably delicious.  Homemade tagliatelle, rich, tart, creamy tomato sauce with lemon (charred lemon rinds actually in the dish), local goat cheese, heirloom tomatoes, locally foraged (in the park?! :O) chanterelles.  I would get it if we go there again.  I had the crabcakes, which were delicious too and were served with broccolini with an excellent tart sauce (maybe lemon and garlic?) and small roasted potato cubes.  Our dessert was a cheese plate, a stinky camembert which I loved and R liked the taste of, but didn't like the smell; a nice mild cheddar; a light, slightly stinky goat cream cheese, and a mild harder cheese, possibly sheep's milk.  We had two interesting beers, New Guy IPA and Bug Lager.
