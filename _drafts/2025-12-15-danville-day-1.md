We were apprehensive 

We packed up and headed out on this very cold morning, a bit earlier than necessary, but we wanted to avoid the snow showers in the forecast from a clipper system expected to cross the state later in the day. If I've learned anything from all those years of watching the local news, it's that you don't want to be on I-80 in the vicinity of Columbia County when it's snowing.

The drive was uneventful, and we arrived much earlier than the standard check-in time at the Pine Barn Inn. Fortunately a room was available, so we were able to check in and get situated immediately after arriving. While we were signing the paperwork at check-in, someone called my father from the hospital to inform us of his report time for tomorrow morning: 8:30am. We'll have plenty of time for a decent night's rest and to get ourselves up to the hospital without hurrying.

While we were driving into town and trying to figure out where it was best to park at the Inn, Dad pointed out a Mexican restaurant right across the street. We kept that in mind for lunch, once we got settled into our room. 

The first room we were assigned, one that was covered under the hospital's voucher program, had two double beds. That sounded fine (after all, that's what we're all accustomed to), but when we saw the beds, they seemed a little too small for Dad's comfort and safety. I returned to the front desk and the woman there was happy (well, maybe not _happy_, but willing) to put us in a double queen room instead, still under the voucher program. Everyone was happier with this arrangement.

The Pine Barn Inn looks like a rustic lodge from the outside. The rooms are pretty much standard fare, but the main building the houses the restaurant, tavern, and front desk is relatively charming and cozy. The convenience of being a three minute walk (or a five to ten minute shuttle bus ride) from the hospital can't be beat.

Today's single-digit temperatures had us all pretty chilled just from carrying our luggage in from the car, so we took some time to warm up before heading out for lunch. 

Galera Dos is in such a convenient location, right across from the Inn, and it's more spacious inside than it appears from the outside. It was busy at lunchtime, but the hostess and servers were warm and friendly, and the atmosphere was equally warm. The complementary chips and salsa were outstanding. The salsa reminded me of the one from another favorite local restaurant, La Tonalteca, with just a hint of spice and lots of cilantro. The locals clearly like the place too, as several town work crews were also enjoying lunch there and taking respite from the cold.

We weren't hungry enough for any of their large entrees, so we all chose items from the a la carte menu: chicken tacos for me, chicken burritos for Lucy, and chicken enchiladas for my father. They were absolutely stuffed with meat! Lucy said that was her chicken quota for the entire month (and she is not a big fan of chicken overall, particularly not when it's shredded). But we all found the meals to be tasty and well-prepared, and just enough to get us through until supper. Another reason we wanted to save some room was because wanted to try the restaurant at the Inn, too. 

The day was still brutally cold, and we all got so thoroughly chilled just walking back across the street from the restaurant that we spent the rest of the afternoon underneath all the blankets we could find, and we turned the heat in the hotel room up to 79 degrees. Dad and Lucy napped while I worked on my website. The chill was finally starting to subside when we decided it was time to check out the hotel restaurant for a "light" supper.

We were all still pretty full from our lunch earlier, so we just had salads (which were also big, but tasty and not overly filling).  I had a spinach salad with pecans, red cabbage, feta, and raisins.  Lucy had a salad with mixed greens, cashews, and mandarin oranges.  And my father had a Caesar salad.  The dessert menu looked good (peach cobbler, apple dumpling, and pumpkin roll were all appealing) and initially we were thinking we might try something, but after finishing the salads, we didn’t have enough room for dessert.  The restaurant was pretty large, simply decorated, and warm.
