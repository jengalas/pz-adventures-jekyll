First full day with Dad in town.  Breakfast from Morning Glory by the waterfront (sticky buns, raspberry jam spot, three seed bagels with cream cheese, tea and coffee), watched a seal in the harbor.  We've never seen one that close to the shore in town. Hike up the South Bubble; Dad did really well, had no trouble with the climbs. Came back down to Jordan Pond and had lunch of chicken salad sandwiches (cranberry-walnut for dad, curry for us) and popovers, of course!  Then we walked around the carriage roads a bit and dad really liked the gatehouse.  We showed him the small BM along the path back to the pond house.

Then we did some car touring for the rest of the afternoon.  We took him down to Somesville, SWH, Seawall, Pretty Marsh etc (and don't forget Bernard!!!) He was dozing part of the time but really enjoyed the tour.  Was trying to orient himself as we went.
