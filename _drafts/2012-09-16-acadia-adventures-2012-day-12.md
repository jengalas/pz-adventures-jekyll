Bagels from Morning Glory (whole wheat with veggie cream cheese) while freezing down by the water.  Many cruise people asking us about where they could buy coffee (uhh ... pretty much anywhere?!)  Wind was freezing cold but the sun was out and it was a cloudless day.  After some investigating online and finding the 1911 map of the island we decided to walk the Jordan Pond Trail (mostly to stay out of the wind as much as we could) and search for the Goat Trail.  It looks like it branches off at the intersection of the Jordan Pond and South Bubble trails (and Jordan Pond Carry Trail) and is supposedly a step and ladder/rung trail up the west side of Pemetic, and is still supposedly in good condition.  We wandered in the woods in that area for a while but couldn't find anything that resembled a trail.  Rich did find some old discarded signposts a few yards into the woods, but they didn't look quite old enough to have had anything to do with the Goat trail.  The rest of the walk around the pond was a peaceful as ever, with gentle breezes (sometimes a little less than gentle, but we were warm enough in the sun), a loon who disappeared underwater and never, apparently, resurfaced, and several stumbles on the "world's longest bogwalk."  Somehow I was able to resist tea and popovers at the Pond House (looking forward to supper I suppose).

The afternoon was spent resting, once we got back to the room around 2:30, and investigating more old trails.  We also found some information about the Pot Hole Trail online, and still need to find out more about the South Bubble Cliff trail.  We spent some time poking around the shops in SWH, especially the amazing Sawyer's grocery store (we were glad we stopped at the Sawyer's wine and cheese shop yesterday, because they apparently aren't open on Sundays).  Supper was at Fiddler's Green, a new place for us.  It was delicious.  We sat in the porch area, and thought we would be freezing in the wind, but it was really comfortable there.  We had Tripel Karmeliet and cask Thornbridge-Jaipur IPA, salt cod fritters and porcini panzeratti. R had the Maine sole stuffed with spinach, cheese, crabmeat, topped with spices and caraway seeds.  I had the halibut with smoked cheddar, tomatoes and herbs de provence.  We both had grilled string beans and zucchini/squash, R had rice and I had roasted potatoes.  Heidi Cake (3-layer cake, sponge cake on bottom, cheese cake in middle and gelatin layer with fruits on top), and espresso.
