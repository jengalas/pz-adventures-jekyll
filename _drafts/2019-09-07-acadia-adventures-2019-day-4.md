Hurricane day! Yikes. Hurricane Dorian provided nearly all-day rain, followed by extreme winds in the evening. One benefit of wild weather is that the town is devoid of tourists (except for us, I guess), as it was this morning. As an added bonus, all the cruise ship arrivals were canceled. It was a very quiet, unusual experience for a Saturday in Bar Harbor. 

Breakfast at Sunrise Cafe which we had all to ourselves as huge raindrops smacked against the windows. Blueberry crepe, veggie crepe which was awesome for R, tea, coffee. Excellent and relatively warm, just started to get chilly near the end.

We worked our way back through town, still mostly deserted, and stopped in a few shops looking for lightweight rain paints for R. Didn't find any although we found heavy ones, light ones that didn't fit, and some that were probably perfect and fantastic but were also almost $200.

We spent some time in the room getting dried and warmed up and then headed out on our little adventure which was t be research at the Northeast Harbor library followed by popovers and light lunch at Asticou. The library was beautiful and we spent a few hours looking at maps, Maine history books and the trail sign exhibit. We barely scratched the surface of what they had available. Could have stayed there all day!

But we were getting hungry and looking forward to those popovers, Unfortunately it was not to be. We got to Asticou (after passing the "Asti-cow" that R spotted in someone's side yard) only to find that the restaurant was closed for a private event. Boo! 

We drove back through NEH thinking we might find somewhere else to eat. Couldn't find much so we tried the Colonel's restaurant. It was good for a "family restaurant," nothing like the places we usually find but certainly more than passable food in a pleasant environment. We shared a crab and a lobster roll with fries and cole slaw.

By now the wind had picked up and it was really cold and nasty. We came back to the room and put the fireplace on and rested for a while, reading some more local history and looking into the first location of the Champlain Monument (one of the deeds talks about pins around the perimeter which would be cool to find!). 

Supper was a small pepperoni pizza at Rosalie's. It was busy and we spent most of the time trying to figure out where the people at the table next t us were from. we could not place the language at all. When we were leaving R finally asked and they said romania.

Evening was spent getting warmed up again in the room and watching a few videos, and reading. We checked out our track log from yesterday and when R was taking a shower I went over to the lobby for the Acadia Weekly (... and a cookie). Christopher was there and he was more than willing to talk about how it's impossible to see all of the island in a lifetime let alone a few hours or days. He told the story of how he tells people it takes at least 3.5 hours to do the park loop road but that there is so much more to see and you can spend as long as you like. And that earlier this year he had a couple who asked about where to eat and what to see. They went to Jordan;s at 9:00am, he saw them flying up the road at 10am, and they were back in the lobby by 11:30 saying they had "done Acadia, what's next?" Wow. I told him about how we're into the local history and look for all the abandoned trails, structures, features etc. He recommended checking out the Archbold estate, which is on our list, and asked if we knew about ehe bears cave. I told him we did (meaning the one by Beaver Dam pool) but he said no, supposedly there is one near Jordan Pond. Have to find out more!
