Bitton for breakfast, made and served crepes by the most stereotypically French looking, sounding and acting guy you can imagine. R had a Lorraine crepes with egg, cheese and ham and I had one with mango (at least a whole mango if not more in large dice), grilled coconut and whipped cream. 

After checking out we drove north to Homestead to spend some more time in the Everglades. Unfortunately it was "every kid in the state of Florida goes on a field trip" day but we still had an enjoyable walk around the Anhinga Trail (in the opposite direction this time) and then on the Gumbo Limbo trail, at the end of which we saw an owl high in a tree, but weren't able to photograph it.

We simply couldn't pass by Robert is Here without stopping. We picked up the mango coconut squares, mango butter and guava jelly for Elaine, pineapple jam for my father and mango butter for my mother. We also sampled an incredibly sweet and juicy mango as well as their homemade salsa and guacamole.

Coming home yikes during one of the craziest February East Coast storms in history! Tornadoes in many states, rain, ice, wind and snow. Flights delayed hours but somehow we were able to take both of our planned flights, just a bit later than expected. We arrived back at AVP at 1:10am after a very long day and two bumpy flights
