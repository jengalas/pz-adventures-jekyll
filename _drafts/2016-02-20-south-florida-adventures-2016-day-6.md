Breakfast from old town bakery at tiki hut, heard history of the lodge (PIzza hut? Howard Johnson's?) From the handyman. He told us about the spongers and how hard it is to get sponges ready for sale. He told us wet could find some in the adjacent marina. W had wanted to take a walk over there anyway, onto the narrow piece of land next to the beach so we walked over there and spent some time looking in the water. We found several sponges! It was so cool to see them with their little holes opening and exuding air or liquid, I'm not sure what.

Our plan for the day was just to explore the nearby area. We had already visited the bat tower two years ago but there were a few other BMs along the road.We struck out on all of them. Weird house appeared to be the right place but we were reluctant to stop. Couldn't access the other area due to posted signs.

Then we crossed the highway and checked out the southern part of sugarloaf. First Mark was a not found, then walked part of the old highway toward the bridge jump where we did find Mon 100. R also found a rope tied around the bridge banister which I assume had something to do with the jumping. (I think all the broken beer bottles had something to do with it as well). Remember the stupid woman who rode by when we went back to the car singing "no parking at any time!" Asshole. "I hate people-how many times have I said that today?"

Next we went to the other end of the old highway which is also a trail now and part of the key deer refuge, which we didn't realize. We were attempting to find a tri-station BUNCH. The description referred to a prairie and large field but when we arrived we could see it was basically a lake. Haha! At least we had a fun walk through lots of interesting jungle like plants and and spider webs that we kept walking into. Even the side road referred to in one of the descriptions was completely under water.

Our next idea was to check out Bahia Honda, but then on Rs suggestion we decided to do Knights Key instead! First had beers (Guinness) oysters St Thomas, and conch fritters at Sunset Grille, then find a bm that we had somehow missed last time on the new highway bridge. Then we walked the bridge in major wind all the way to Pigeon Key and back. Gorgeous sunny and warm day by this point. We took our time and even noticed a new bm along the way. Nothing much to be seen on the water today because it was so choppy. We did see a bright green iguana near one of the knights key bridge marks that we found last time. Went into the gift shop to Sr of they knew anything about the ramp but she didn't. Just that it was damaged and the DOT wouldn't approve its use but also wouldn't fix it.

We went back to the room briefly before heading to the Square Grouper for supper.We were quite early but were the second people in line and our was a good thing we were so early because the place was packed from the beginning.it was really great, good service, bright interior and excellent food. We started with two small plates, coconut shrimp with mango sauce and baked goat cheese with fig and onion jam and local honey, and sesame flatbread crackers. Bread was multigrain roll with cranberries, pretzel roll, and French roll. Beers were the Floridian and Stone IPA. Entree was shrimp cakes on artichoke bottoms with delicious creamy rice pilaf with wild rice and broccolini. Really excellent! We came back to the room and dozed off before 7pm.
