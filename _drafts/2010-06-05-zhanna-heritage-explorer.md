Well, John, unfortunately you missed an interesting ride on Saturday! 

The weather looked good enough in the morning that I knew it would be worth trying the ride (Rich's encouragement helped me make up my mind too, of course!). I figured the rain would hold off for at least most of the morning, long enough for me to at least get to Carbondale, where I could call Rich and see if it was worth heading home or if I should find a culvert to hide in for the next couple hours.  My only real goal was to do the “Carbondale Special”, but I knew in my heart I wanted to try to complete the longest route, the “Wildcat” to Union Dale, if possible.

I left the house right around 7:45am and rode down to Mellow Park. I was seriously thinking I might be the only person to show up for this thing, other than Joe Snedeker, of course. But at the park the atmosphere was already quite festive. The walking path was lined with balloons tied to lampposts leading the way down to the registration area near the bleachers. I picked up my bag of goodies, most of which I had to stuff into my tiny Black Diamond Bbee pack since I had nowhere else to put it while I rode.  (Note: next year I should either drive to the start of the ride, or go to the packet pickup the night before at the Trolley Museum!)  I tossed most of the pamphlets and brochures for local attractions; I kept only the cue sheets and a free admission ticket to Steamtown.  And of course the t-shirt and water bottle.

While I was attaching my rider number to my pack and swallowing a banana and some water, I heard someone comment that they loved my "moose" jersey. Two women in a group standing near me wanted to know all about it, and one of them said that she had been nicknamed Moose since high school. They appeared to be somewhat serious mountain bikers.  I rode near this group on and off during the morning so I heard plenty of "go moose!" 

Anyway, for some reason the race organizers had decided to do away with set start times, so I began when I was ready, probably around 8:20am. The first several miles of the ride followed our typical River Trail to Archbald route. Unfortunately, we did not ride the fun, fast section of relatively-unimproved trail between Archbald and the sewage treatment plant in Jermyn with a series of dips we call “whoop-de-doos”.  One of the "moose girls" was equally disappointed about that, I soon found out; she had wanted to show that section to her son who was along on the ride. We crossed the bridge and went out onto Main St./ S. Washington Ave. instead, following it all the way through Jermyn. 

About half a mile after turning up onto Old Plank Rd., we made an abrupt right turn over a little dirt berm and down to the 1-mile Mayfield section of the trail that passes behind St. Rose Academy. Then we rode the roads into Carbondale—somewhere along Gordon Ave. our only spectator along the whole route, a little cat, crossed our path and sat in the ditch and watched us ride by—and we navigated the streets of the "Pioneer City" until we reached the old train station. For most of the ride to this point, I was riding by myself but was usually near other groups, overtaking them or they were overtaking me. Somewhere the moose people had fallen behind, but they caught up here. I loaded up on water and granola bars, and called Rich. When he didn't see any rain at all on the radar, I decided I would try to make it to Union Dale. I was still feeling pretty strong and energetic, and even though it was a warm and humid day I felt well hydrated. 

After Carbondale, I discovered something new. While I was riding along Enterprise Drive near the moose people and a few other small groups, three roadies made a sharp right hand turn onto a wooded trail while the rest of us stayed on the road. The trail soon turned back north to parallel the road, and I knew I had to try it on my way back. (I found out later that this trail was actually the route we were supposed to take, according to the cue sheets, but the turn wasn't marked as all the others had been.) 

On the O&W, I followed most of the moose group at a distance (two of them were quite a distance behind me, for some reason). So here it was much more like a solo ride. The conditions here were the worst I'd encountered to this point, but the trail was still a little better than I expected. It's not ballast rock, but there are rocky sections, holes, muddy areas and overall "black dirt" that make it somewhat less pleasant than the more improved trails. Could have been rough on a road bike, but I did enjoy this section even though it wore me out a bit and I had to drop my speed pretty dramatically. At the crossover point, I passed the moose people, who were stopped for some reason, and I didn't see them again for a long time. 

My entire trip along the D&H between the crossover and the Forest City trailhead was solo.  This section is the steepest grade of the entire route, and it’s wide and exposed, so I was really starting to heat up here.  Fortunately the road surface, although dirt, is extremely smooth and there was a breeze (and some wild strawberries off the side of the path for snacks) so this section was much more pleasant than it could have been.  

When I reached the parking lot at the Forest City trailhead, I spotted and nearly caught up with two people who were riding ahead of me: a guy who was pretty nondescript, just looked like a typical mountain biker, and a quite chunky girl with a wide butt (forgive me, but that was just my first impression!).  I took a slight detour and rode the “Tree Trail” around the parking lot before rejoining the D&H, while they rode straight through the parking lot, so I didn’t quite catch up to them.  The girl really seemed to be booking it, though!  I could hardly believe how quickly she was moving.  She was consistently getting a few dozen yards ahead of Nondescript Guy before slowing down to let him catch up.  I matched their speed pretty well, but stayed behind to ride my own ride.  I also stopped briefly to take a photo of the strawberries at this point.  I had intended to take more, but I was feeling strong and had such a good rhythm going that, honestly, once I was riding I really didn’t want to stop at all!  

Somewhere past Stillwell Dam, I passed who I suddenly realized was the first rider I’d seen going in the opposite direction.  Wow, I thought, this means I could actually be only the fourth person, assuming Bertha Superfast and Nondescript Guy didn’t pause along the way, to reach the final stop!  Even though it wasn’t a race, this was still satisfying for some reason.
