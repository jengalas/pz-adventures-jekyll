Today was a warm, increasingly humid, and windy day that was perfect for another relaxed day of restful activities and just poking around. While eating our breakfast (leftover pizza and blueberry yogurt, and then a little later on a blueberry muffin that we shared), and discussing everything from dinner plans to personal knowledge management systems to the book "Timekeepers," at some point we decided that I would go for a practice run on part of the 5K course this morning. This worked out well because Rich could take a shower and relax for a while as I ran and then made my way to the Frenchman Bay lobster storefront across from Agamont Park to pick up a light lunch for us.

Everything worked out pretty much as planned. Rather than beginning at the course's official starting point on Main Street, I just ran down Holland Avenue and joined West Street there. The reason for this was mainly that I just wanted to test out the hilly section on West Street and Cleftstone Avenue, but it turned out that it was a good idea not to go further into town anyway because it was so incredibly busy that running there was nearly impossible (as I found out later).

There were a few tourists to dodge on West Street, but after that I had the entire course to myself. I had entered the route into my watch to test out the navigation feature, but I realized en route that I didn't know how to zoom in on the displayed map, so it was tricky to follow. I was about to turn onto Cleftstone Road but it didn't seem that I had run far enough on West Street (there is a maze of roads in this area, and I thought maybe CLeftstone had two intersections with West Street [it does not]). So I continued up West Street a bit longer when I got a "course deviation" warning from my watch. So back to Cleftstone I went, where there was a bit of a reprieve before the final climb up to Eagle Lake Road began. Turning onto Eagle Lake Road, I traveled downhill for a short distance and then turned onto Cromwell Harbor Road. This is a mostly level (with slightly rolling hills) stretch alongside the golf course. At one point it comes very close to the northwest corner of the Great Meadow Loop, so I decided to take the trail instead of the road for that section. The trail emerges again on the road, where I continued the official route, ending up at the ballfields where the race will finish. But because my route was shortened a bit, I ended up with between 4.25-4.5km and I wanted to make the full 5. I ran down to Main Street and tried running on the sidewalks in town, but it was just too busy. And I hadn't seen *anything* yet! I finished the 5K right around Havana, where I crossed over to check out their posted menu (it's still the summer menu, which is usually a good thing because they often have tropical desserts that I like). Then I headed deeper into town and basically slammed into a wall of cruise ship tourists everywhere I went. You could barely even walk on the sidewalks, let alone run. It was just insane. 

Eventually I made my way to the lobster stand, where I ordered a large classic roll (cold lobster salad with mayo and lettuce). The little stand was busy, but not quite as busy as it appeared at first glance because there is a line for ordering (only two couples in front of me) and another nearby line for people waiting for their food (about 6 people in line). It took about 10 minutes, but the roll was large and beautifully presented when it came out. I was sweating like a pig, so I had to use one of the provided napkins immediately to wipe the sweat from my eyes. At least I don't _think_ I dripped any onto the lobster roll!

Now the challenge was to get the lobster roll back to the room quickly and intact. That wasn't happening if I took the main roads, so I ran through parking lots and back alleys to make my way back efficiently.  

We split the roll and ate it on the porch. It was delicious and filling and gave me plenty of protein to rebuild after today's exercise. 

Rich wanted to get out for an afternoon walk too, so we went down to the Hannaford to pick up a few things including some wine to have with tonight's Blondihacks pizza party! (Of course we're still going to do that while on vacation!) Feeling even more humid and windy at this time.

And it wasn't much later, just after 4:00pm and after resaerching a few benchmarks that we may search for later in the week, that I headed down to Rosalie's for our pizza. I ordered a medium cheese pizza this time. They were getting so many takeout orders, and they said it would take about 20-25 minutes, so I had some time to work my way back through the crowds and buy some blueberry mango jam for Elaine (and one jar for us to try, since we had forgotten to pick up some jam at Hannaford to have with our naan rounds). Rich was waiting at the door with a big smile on his face when I appeared with the pizza. He had everything set up, including the Blondihacks video set up to appear in the background of our photo. I obtained a few large paper plates from the hotel lobby, and we were ready to begin the pizza party! It was as awesome as ever, and the video was a great one too. We followed it up with the newest Sidetrack Adventures video and then a few Airline News updates. Awesome, relaxing evening!
