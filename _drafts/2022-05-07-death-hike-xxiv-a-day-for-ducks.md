About a month ago, Ken and I began our traditional annual planning sessions. While it is nominally a relaxing and joyful activity to celebrate the senior math majors' conquering of their challenging curriculum, it also marks the end of the academic year for me and Ken, and—despite the weather—is usually the first activity of the year that makes us believe that despite the long winter we've just had, summer truly is coming.

The history of the Death Hike is long and varied, but for its first 21 years, it was held at Glen Onoko Falls on the Tuesday before Memorial Day. The closure of the Glen Onoko Falls trail in 2019 and then COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 required us to change our plans (and even the date of the hike) significantly. 

<!-- (See last year's write-up for more details about that.) -->

Planning session on April 6. Due to the fact that graduation was moved up to May 21 this year, there is no Senior Week, and of course the Monkses will be leaving for Colorado by the 21st. So there is no opportunity to use the traditional Death Hike algorithm to choose the date. We could also not choose a weekday due to classes, and the weekend before finals was out. So our only option was the weekend of May 7-8. For no really good reason, we chose Saturday, the 7th.

We also had to choose a new venue. The traditional venue, Glen Onoko Falls trail, was closed to public access in 2019, just after our last in-person Death Hike. We had discussed possibly holding future hikes along the appropriately named Shades of Death trail in Hickory Run State Park. The park has a lot of interesting history, somewhat somber and spooky, which would make it an appropriate location. But the hike itself would be rather tame, without much elevation gain and no great views to be had. Still, we thought it was a good choice.

After more than a day of solid rain and temperatures in the low 40s, it felt nothing like a typical Death hike day! Although it is not the earliest day in the year that we've ever held the Death Hike (that distinction belongs to Death Hike XXI in 2019, which was held on April 27 due to threats to close the Glen Onoko Trail on May 1 (which in fact did happen) - and that day was a gorgeous one), it certainly felt like we were still in winter today. Our entire spring has been very cold and wet, with only about two days that anyone could possibly label "springlike." And today was certainly not one of them. The rain from a very slow moving system began falling over Pennsylvania on Thursday night, and was still going strong (no breaks) on Saturday morning when I got up at 5:30 for the hike.

I had a very light breakfast at home, because Gina always makes a delicious breakfast scramble for us ("Gina's eggs!") before the hike. Gina and I had mushrooms, spinach, and romano cheese in our scramble, while Ken had eggbeaters with diced turkey bacon.

After the usual chatting, during which I heard the story of Bonnie Xiong and the manatees (she developed a rare form of lung cancer and, although treatment is working and she has been in remission for a year, she has been working on her bucket list. One of the items is to see manatees in Florida. At some point Gina received a phone call that appeared to be from Bonnie's phone, although her name was spelled wrong. Although this would seem to indicate a spammer/spoof, Monks said it was perfectly in line with Bonnie's character. Gina passed the phone to Ken. It was apparently someone who worked at the manatee marina/place in Florida. They found Bonnie's brand new iPhone at the bottom of the marina slip in at least several feet of water. It still worked(!) but they were unable to unlock the phone, so they used Siri to attempt to call random names until they hit a winner with Gina. Ken told them that they knew who the phone belonged to. He called Bonnie's son, who was with her int he car, and they were only about an hour away from the manatee place. They turned around to retrieve the phone. Ken said he wants credit for finding her lost iPhone in Florida while he was in Colorado!)

We left the house around 9am (or planned to; we were running a few minutes late). Still raining - even more heavily than when I arrived. And only about 42°. Arrived at the new Visitor's Center for Hickory Run State Park around 9:35 (having received a text message from Richard, as Ken called it ahead of time, saying "Am I in the right spot?"). It only took me a second to figure out what Ken meant by the Tautological Sidewalk. Then we went inside to stay dry while we waited for the other students who were supposedly on their way. I picked up a few park maps and wandered through the elaborate displays in the center, noting the Shade of Death exhibit, and that it would make a good spot for our traditional group photos if we were unable to take them outside due to the weather or lack of a stable place for the camera.

The other three students were traveling together, and a detour rerouted them significantly. They arrived at the visitors center around 10am. It was pouring even harder by this point! We went with the option to take our "before" photo in front of the Shades of Death display, and Barbara, a friendly older woman working at the front desk was happy to take a few photos for us. She probably thought we were nuts, but wished us well, and we headed out on the trail!

The Shades of Death Trail begins behind (just west of) the visitors center. after attempting and mostly failing at a selfie at the "Shades of Death Trail" signpost, the hike truly began. We hiked the first portion of the train, which is in this area basically just a wide grassy road, for just a short distance until we met up with the Deer Trail, which we followed northbound. By this point, really only a few minutes into our hike, everyone was already quite wet, and the students, who mostly were without rain gear, were thoroughly soaked. But we all pressed on. The Deer Trail is an easy walk with grassy footing for the most part, and the trail narrows in some sections due to overgrowth. We soon emerged on Sand Spring Road, which we crossed to follow a series of paved roads north and then west over to the Ridge Trail. The paved roads gave everyone a break to walk side by side and catch up on some conversation. (It did not give us any kind of a break from the rain!) 

The students were so wet and, in some cases not wearing "appropriate footwear," so we hiked only the first of two quarter-mile sections we had planned along the Ridge Trail. This trail is somewhat steep and narrow, with slippery-when-wet (possibly even when dry) footing. It was fine to give the students a very brief taste of it, but they didn't need to follow the second section when the old road very close by would make for safer footing and ultimately deliver us to the same spot.

We passed the small chapel and then emerged on Route 534, where we took a small detour to the old cemetery cloistered in the woods just north of the highway. Here we were able to find some of the graves from the dam burst catastrophe that Ken told us about during one of his "living kiosks" throughout the walk. Had it been a nicer day, we would have spent much more time here exploring and examining the old headstones.


Story while we were cleaning up with bathroom and beach towels in the visitors center of little kid asking why we had been hiking and mother shaking her head and saying "I have no idea, honey, I really have no idea."
