"Subdued" is a good description of this year's Death Hike (as much in opposition to the term "Death Hike" as that may be). That was fine with both me and Dr. Monks, since we both have been swamped for over a year with various projects. A simple, relatively quiet hike in the woods was exactly what we needed.

But the more I thought about it, the driving distances and times were just unreasonable. So I decided to go directly from home to Ricketts Glen (of course, inserting a few benchmark hunts along the way) and wait for next year to enjoy Gina's delicious breakfast scramble.
