Morning Glory pastries for breakfast (whole grain with veggie cream cheese, sticky bun, and Earl Grey cookies for trail snacks), eaten at the gazebo as always.  It was much warmer than expected, so much so that I had to remove my jacket!  The sun makes such a difference.  We talked for nearly an hour while we watched the harbor.

Before our planned hike for today, Rich called the guy at Acadia Park Kayak Tours.  He seemed very interested in taking us to Sheep Porcupine but needs to look into the specifics.

We drove to Jordan Pond House, where we found parking in the main lot, and not a moment too soon, because the minute we parked people began arriving.  Our plans were changed by the fact that both the Bubble Pond (where we had planned to park) and Bubble Rock parking areas are completely closed right now.  They are being modified, we think to add more room for the Island Explorer buses.  We later realized we could have parked at Jordan Pond and still done the hike we had planned by using the bus, but at the time we didn't realize that, so we altered our plans somewhat.

We took the Pond Trail (once we found it) up to the West Cliff Trail (on our map-the name has been changed to Pemetic Mountain South Ridge Trail) and followed it to the main trail toward the summit.  Searched for Goat Trail from the summit, but unfortunately saw no sign of it.

I think we'll need to search from the Park Loop Road, and we also want to contact the author of Trails of History to see if he has any information about it.  Went down the North Ridge Trail (get new name) which was long and extremely rocky.  We were both suffering to some degree!

Once down on the carriage road we decided to change our plans and try to get the bus at Bubble Pond instead of walking the carriage roads and Pond Trail back. It worked out well after we waited for the blasting, and we were back at Jordan Pond House by just after 3:00pm.  We poked around in the gift shop for a few minutes before heading back to the car.

Snack of goat cheese (from yesterday!) and crackers!

Dinner was at Side Street Cafe: lobster roll and peppery sweet potato chips for me, and Allagash White; halibut with apple cider reduction and fresh veggies for R, unfiltered IPA; blueberry pie for dessert.  Walked around town looking for moose placemats in the touristy shops; spotted a First Light at Cadillac Mountain jigsaw puzzle that we should probably buy.  Got bus schedule in case we need or want to use it again!  back at the room found out about the Pemetic (Ravine) Trail from Soul of a National Park book.  We'll have to try that one next time because it has ladders!
