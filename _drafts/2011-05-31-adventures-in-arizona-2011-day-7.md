Earthquake research 4330

CY1152, RM2, RM3

AZHD (unstamped)

Chiricahua! Awesome hike on Sarah Deming trail to Heart of Rocks. Duck on a Rock, Punch and Judy, Camels Head. 

Smoke in the air from nearby wildfires--we saw all the haze on the way in. 64k acres burning in the Chiricahua wilderness, according to the ranger, but not at the National Monument.

trip to Willcox first, trying to find Earthquake Research Station. Told guy at water tower what we we doing.  He didn't know anything about the mark but had no problem with us poking around looking for it. We looked all around for 45 minutes without finding the mark. We were looking for a nice solid probably smooth ledge. I even checked the other side of the road and found a rock with what appeared to be bedrock mortars! but no mark. I was just about to call of the search so we could head toward Chiricahua when r spotted the disk just 17 feet from the coordinates. It was just lying on the ground in a chunk of broken up concrete. Apparently it had never even Been drilled into the rock! Took photos and coordinates so we could report it as destroyed. R knocked the remaining piece of concrete off the mark, and we took it.

Saw total of 13mule deer (4pm the trail in Chiricahua, in the Ryolite Canyon area, 8crossing the highway in a group, and one that darted out in front of us on the way back. 

Variety of zones on the trail. Wonderful smell of pine, especially when we wreewnt smelling the fire. Curious lizards popping up along the way while we hiked. Rattlesnake just off the trail on the way down! We both heard the buzzing and at the same time said "that doesn't sound like crickets--that...sounds like a rattlesnake!!!" then a tense few seconds passed while we searched fir it.  Then a tense few minutes as r took photos and then as we tried to get aroud it. "can you run?" r couldn't really but he was up for it at this point! He went first and caught the snakes attention enough that he turned his head but did not strike. The distraction gave me enough time to pass also, and we had a god laugh afterward! It was a thrilling moment to be so close to a snake that we rarely see.

Nibbling on pistachios on a perfect natural bench along the trail, down about a quarter mile past the bottom of the switch aids on the way down. Rs ailing toe was feeling a litle it better at this point. Magical walk through Rhyolite Canyon on the way back to the car.  Neither of us wanted to leave.

PONERY 2 on the way back to Tucson:found station and 2 rms easily but could not find final RM. I thought I saw something. That resembled concrete buried inside a tough shrub so I called rich out o cute car to help check I tout.  But when we got back to the spot, I could see that it had been an illusion, simply some webs on top of. Dirt that looked like concrete when the sun hit it. R and I both searched the hillside, with compass and gps and benchmark hunters' intuition, but npwith no result except except some adot marks at the corner of the fence. 

By now we were starving so we headed toward Salsa Fiesta, which we had been looking forward to for four years, seriously. This was the worst shock of the trip--they're closed on Tuesdays!!! Now what were we going sto do? We tried another place in Willcox (yes just like four years ago, there still aren't very many places to eat in Willcox) A Taste of Coronado, which owed. From their website like a very nice place (probably too nice for how dirty and sweaty. But we didn't care at this point) and that features local wine (which we could both really use at this point). Guess what? Yes, if you've been following align you will have guessed that they too are closed on Tuesdays.  And Wednesdays. 

I'd still felt bad about not going for BBq yesterday when R suggested it, so I thought we'd see if we could make it back to Tucson before starving and try the BBQ place I'd read about online, Billy bryants BBQ. I called them only to find out that their kitchen closes at 7:45 pm. According to Jill we would arrive at7:24 pm. This was definitely not enough of a margin for us to even attempt it. After much back and forth in the car trying to use the gps to find something worthwhile, which is most definitely not an easy task, we decided to try the closest BBQ place to our hotel, Jacks original BBQ. We ordered takeout. Ribs, pork ( of which we got a sample there) brisket with rolls, Cole slaw, potato salad and chili beans. Of course we forgot to ask for plasticware and did not see any in the bag, so we wasted our time on the way back stopping in fast food restaurants trying to find some plasticware. I never noticed that they don't have it out, bu they don't. At this time we were starving and fried and just decked to go back to the room and eat with our hands if necessary. I asked in the lobby and was thrilled to discover that they did in fact have forks, spoons and knives, at about the same time r was back in room opening the BBQ containers and realizing that after all that,  some plastic knives, forks and napkins were tucked neatly into the BBq takeout containers. So, a far cry from sipping local wines at A Taste of Coronado or even pigging out at the salsa bar at Salsa Fiesta, we had a relaxing night eating BBQ and drinking beer in bed.
