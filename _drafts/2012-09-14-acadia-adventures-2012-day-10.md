Friday was a rest day, mostly. Breakfast with my father before he left (remember how we went by his hotel later on to make sure he had left and hadn't fallen asleep!) down by the water, and short hike on Shore Trail, which he liked even though it was foggy and there were no views. Fog mostly cleared up quite early and we decided to take a trip to "our spot" but we had to find it first.  got suspected coordinates and went to the spot; we were very close.  Stayed there for a while just resting and reading and enjoying the sunshine.  Then took a ride to Otter Point to see if we could find anything remaining of the old OTTER station.  We did find a drill hole at the coordinates and some anchor bolts spread around.  Burning Tree for supper! Dave and family came over in the evening for some wine and to set up plans for tomorrow.
