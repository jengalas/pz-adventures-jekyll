[private role="administrator"]At 6:30am I awoke to a blaring alarm and Rich's grumbled response "I don't <em>think </em>so!!!" It was nearly 9:00am by the time we got moving, some more leg cramps having changed our plans a bit. Today's breakfast was simply some pre-sliced melon we'd bought on Friday at Price Chopper. We loaded up everything into the car and headed out, but our adventures were far from over. Our first stop was Whiteface. The experience was well worth the $14 toll to drive to the top. we took our time along the toll road, as usual, stopping at overlooks along the way and even seeing two red fox pups. The views of the high peaks, Green Mountains, and Lake Champlain were incredible. We finally got to the top, and got to drive through the castle before parking! We chose to hike up the remaining 270' to the summit rather than take the elevator. Wow!!! We found the WHITEFACE MTN tri-station and reference marks easily, though the swarms of tourists made the recovery challenging. The day was so clear and sunny, we didn't want to leave the open summit. We sat for well over an hour on the ledges, just talking and identifying as many high peaks as we could. After poking around the summit house a bit, we took the elevator back down and then walked out to the parking area through the chilly tunnel (45Â° air!) We left very reluctantly. Our next stop was the train station for the Adirondack Scenic Railway, where I reported an overflowed toilet in the restroom and nearly got myself into the locomotive cab. :) It looked like so much fun, especially the hot dog, pizza, and ice cream trains (we want to know where the beer train is!). But we decided to save the ride for our next trip. We finally got to the Brown Dog Cafe for lunch. They have a rather unorthodox ordering system -- you take an order sheet, circle what you want, turn it in at the counter, and wait to be called for your sandwich just a few minutes later. It was neat, a little confusing at first, and then fun to watch everybody else's confusing after we'd figured it out. We had gourmet roast beef and turkey sandwiches that were hearty and delicious. Then we headed to John Brown's farm (describe), where we found a landmark station and tri-station. On the way home we were craving ice cream and stopped at the Noon Mark Diner in Keene Valley, only to wait at least half an hour. The ice cream did taste good, though. After making our way through insane traffic, we finally got to New Paltz, where we detoured to the Mountain Brauhaus for desserts (the kitchen was closed) and, of course, beers before making our way back to Jessup.[/private]
