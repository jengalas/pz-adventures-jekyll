Arrived at motel 3:00 am, having been awake basically for 26 hours straight. Grimy doesn't begin to describe how utterly sticky and filthy we felt after a full day spent on planes and hanging around airports, but unfortunately by the time we finally arrived at the motel the only thing we wanted to do, the only thing we could do was to wash up briefly and collapse in bed. Slept until 8:00, at which time I felt, very unexpectedly, quite refreshed. R didn't have quite the same spring in his step yet, but he quickly came around once the bright sunlight hit his eyes and the delicious Mexican breakfast hit his stomach. We'd asked the Mexican-looking woman working in the motel lobby this morning to recommend a good breakfast. She wanted to send us across the highway to Country Folks, a decent little diner (which we had visited on our first visit in 2007) and really the only place to grab a decent meal within walking distance. "No," we said, we'd really prefer a Mexican breakfast. "Oh, anywhere on 4th Avenue will be great.  Just get yourselves there (and here followed directions that did, eventually, get us there) and anything you find will be good."

We decided on Micha's Mexican Restaurant, the first place we found that, fortunately, also looked clean and modern.  A few other solo diners enjoyed mid-morning snacks as we devoured our machaca and eggs (for me) and machaca and egg burrito (for R), basically the same except the burrito contained green chiles and was, obviously, wrapped in a huge freshly steamed flour tortilla.  Delicious, relatively authentic, friendly service, interesting salsa that was just slightly unusual, very tomatoey with the taste of Mexican oregano. 

Tucson Visitors Center - we "followed the lizards" (lizards painted on the sidewalk and in village) in Tucson downtown area (La Placita Village, bizarrely painted collection of Mexican-inspired adobe and brick buildings serving as a low-key retail establishment) . Anne sold us our savings passport and several t-shirts from Sabaku Artwear (which she let me try on in the restroom) and said she'd always thought the hardest working people were from Pennsylvania. I don't know about that, but it was an interesting observation.

It was already midday and the temperature had climbed steadily to 103°, which we were certainly not accustomed to.  Still, we needed to get out and enjoy the sunshine on a hike!  As usual, Saguaro National Park West would be our first hiking destination.  Following the suggestion of a volunteer in the park's Visitor Center, we hiked the Sendero Esperanza trail south toward its intersection with the Hugh Norris trail. It was a very beautiful, colorful desert hike even with the sun that we weren't used to in our eyes.  It seared our skin (we had worn plenty of sunscreen so no lasting damage) but we felt light, wafting breezes the entire time, more than enough to keep us comfortable.  Not wanting to push ourselves on our first warm day since last summer (literally!), we turned around just past the ridge.  That gave us a total hike distance of around 4 miles, but it was a very good choice of a hike to begin our acclimatization.  While we let the car run to cool off for a while, we sat at the picnic table (Ez-Kim-In-Zin!) and ate our pistachios and watched birds hopping all around us, including a Gila woodpecker and some cute, tiny ground squirrels running with their tails in the air.

Supper was early at Mi Nidito.  Early enough, in fact, that we could walk right in, to our great surprise.  Within a few minutes, the restaurant was packed.  I had the chicken flautas and R had a beef burrito with red sauce (he had asked for green but got red and once he saw it, decided to just keep it.  It was excellent.)  We both had Negra Modelo to drink.

Then we decided to try to find the gelato place.  Of the three locations (none of which we knew) we decided to try the one on Skyline Drive.  It's in a large outdoor luxury mall with a sushi place (RA) that was packed. We loved our gelato, which turned out to be too much because we had ordered mediums so we could try two different flavors each.
