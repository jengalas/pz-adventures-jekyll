Although the severe storms we were supposed to get overnight didn't really materialize, it rained at some point during the early morning, and everything was still wet when we woke up. There was no rain at all during the day, and skies were cloudy this morning, very eventually clearing by afternoon. We had another low-key day in mind, which we began with treat from Mount Dessert Bakery again. Today I had a bagel with veggie cream cheese and Darjeeling tea instead of my usual Earl Grey, dad had a sesame bagel sandwich, and R had a sandwich on a croissant. We also ordered some treats for a little snack later: blueberry scone for Dad, blueberry Danish for R, and blueberry hand pie for me. We brought them back to the porch to eat as usual, when we realized that Dad hadn't actually gotten his scone. I ran back down to see if they still had some, and they were happy to give me one no questions asked. I think the new girl at the register was just flustered and forgot to put it into the bag.

After breakfast we took a slow stroll along the Shore Path, something we traditionally do on Dad's last morning here, but we thought today would be a better day for it. Skies were very cloudy and gray, but it was very calm and pleasant for walking. IT seems less busy the last two days than it had been the first week we were here - more like a normal September, for which we are thankful! 

The Shore Path wasn't overly busy today and we had opportunities to take a few photos and explore the rocks, plantings, and homes and inns along the route. I met another woman with a "real camera" while we walked around the cobbles on the beach. I tried to photograph the balance rock and small sea stack. Rich and dad spotted a woman with a tiny dog in a backpack carrier and two more in a baby stroller. 

After our walk and checking out the menu at Havana (still the nice summer menu) we split up for a few hours because Dad wanted to take the Park Loop Road bus around the park, and Rich wanted to check out the Acadia Outdoors store downtown. When we pased by Peekytoe Provisions, I spotted Karen from the Flowered Apron bakery delivering her goodies. She confirmed that she will be open Saturday morning with lots of goodies including lemon bars, lemon-blueberry cake, apple walnut cake, and more. 

We didn't find much exciting at the shop, but we checked out Paddy's because I was interested in finding out whether they were open all afternoon or closed between lunch and supper. They are open straight through from noon-9pm, so no problems there.

Then I returned to the room and Rich made a quick stop at Hannaford before we enjoyed our snack on the porch. :) I had wondered if we might take a little drive over toward Great Head, toward what looked like the start of an old road that I had spotted on Monday when we were driving back from Great Head. Rich was game, so we parked at the Great Head parking area again (still a few open spots!) and headed back up the road a very short distance to a spot where a few boulders and a grassy path leading uphill marked the spot of interest.

We followed the obvious path, clearly an old road, northerly until we reached an intersection point. We chose to go to the right at first, and again followed a clear, reasonably well=worn path as it looped around to the south and east toward a wooded summit. The straight approach again widened to a road grade that was lined with a beautiful stone retaining wall stretching for at least 100 feet on the eastern side. A quick walk through low brush and lichen, and we emerged on a ledge that at one time must have had an amazing view! Now it's blocked by conifers but the ocean is still visible through the trees.

We retraced our steps and, back at the intersection, took the leftmost path this time. It too was very easy to follow and seemed to be leading us toward the Schooner Head Overlook. At first we weren't sure we wanted to go that far, but we realized we were only a few hundred feet away, so we completed the trail and popped out on a ledge 10 feet or so above the road in to the overlook parking lot. Working our way down was easy enough, and we hiked back along the road (note: the route through the woods is quicker, and of course more interesting!)

The old road is apparent on our 1942 topo map, and it shows a building at the summit that we are trying to find out more about. Perhaps someone's house or cabin/cottage? It had to be something worthy of building that retaining wall but we saw no evidence of quarrying or anything like that.

Supper at Paddy's was meant to be light, but keep in mind for the future that all of their portions are huge! R and I started with Guinness of course, and Dad had Paddy's "Irish" lager. R and I had planned to split one appetizer and one sandwich, thinking that would make for a light meal. Think again! The crab and lobster dip was a rich, creamy, cheesy dip served with flatbread (and they brought us plenty more bread as the portion of dip was substantial). Too bad dad couldn't have any because it really was good, and extremely filling. Then the server, Johnm brought out our sandwiches. Dad had the famous Wexford fish sandwich (which he and i have had many times) and loved it, of course. The sandwich Rich and I split was a "dublin pub dip", "Shaved Slow Roasted All-Natural Ribeye, Irish Cheddar, Horseradish Cream, Caramelized Onions, Porter Beef Jus, Hearth Baked Roll". Huge! Even half was a little too much for both of us, but it was really delicious. We really liked the onions and horseradish sauce, a great complement to the beef. We were all WAY too full for an ice cream dessert, which we originally thought we might have.

After stuffing ourselves we walked back through the "Shantytown of the North" as we called it on the waterfront, and then when we got back to the room showed dad the bronze medallion I had made for our 10th anniversary.
