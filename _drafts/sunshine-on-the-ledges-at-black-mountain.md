> I'm writing this from the future: April 2, 2023. Last night, while watching an episode of "The Curse of Oak Island" that featured wide stone walls. Rich paused the video, turned to me, and asked "Wasn't there a hike we did where we were walking between these very wide, high stone walls?" I had had a similar vague memory, but didn't recall enough of it to even mention it. 
> 
> This simple question led to an evening of investigation into my notes, our photos and tracklogs, and eventally archived email messages. A message I had sent to the geocacher "Papadadio" in June 2006 was enough to help us crack the case. 
> 
> We finally figured out that the place with the wide stone walls was the Indian Hill loop trail in Sterling Forest State Park, which we hiked on May 29, 2006. That same message mentioned a hike we did the following day, to Black Mountain in Harriman State Park.

> What follows is what we were able to piece together from the notes, email messages, and other clues we were able to find about our hike to Black Mountain.


Hike at Black Mountain in Harriman.  Parked at bottom of old ski slope, took yellow trail up.  Great conversation, desire for carnival pizza, lots of lounging in the sun.  Decided to leave the "legendary" Spanish Mine search for another day, though we did locate a pit/shaft for a mine close by, on top of the ridge.  Hiked back and Rich started to suffer horrible cramps.  We had intended to look for the Cranberry Mine on the way back, but didn't want to risk it with the way Rich's legs were feeling.  We'll do it next time.  For the second day in a row, we decided to stop at Crystal Run Crossing for supper, this time at Chili's.  We had a tasty cheese and beef dip, and I had chicken tacos that were actually quite spicy.  I couldn't resist the strawberry lime margarita cheesecake for dessert.  Good conversation about music!  Hurried out of there when the sky turned black, fortunately we didn't have much rain or storms to worry about on the way back.
