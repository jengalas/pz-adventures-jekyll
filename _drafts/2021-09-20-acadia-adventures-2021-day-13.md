Just like last Monday, the line at Mount Dessert Bakery was out the door when we arrived just after 7am. But it moved quickly and before too long, we were back onour porch enjoying our toasted bagels with the last of the lox cream cheese, coffee, and tea.

Unsure where to explore today, we both looked at the map for a while and I suggested returning to the Fawn Pond area to see if we could follow more of the roads and trails we found yesterday. Rich had a better idea, though—he suggested hiking the southern section of Breakneck Road, from Eagle Lake Road to the Breakneck ponds. I've actually never hiked there and was looking forward to being able to create a tracklog of the entire route, even though I hadn't thought about it until he mentioned it. 

We were lucky to get almost the last spot in the Eagle Lake carriage road parking lot right around 9am. The only slightly tricky part of our walk was the short jaunt uphill on Route 3 alongside traffic going 50+mph, not my idea of fun. But it was quick and we had no problems, and were soon walking north along Breakneck Road.

The first section is lined with poison  ivy and the road is now much narrower than Rich recalls it from years ago. It was very peaceful and quiet without another person to be seen or heard anywhere. We noticed bits of crumbling old asphalt in a section of the road here, indicating that at least this small portion of it had once been paved. A creek flowed swiftly along the western side of the trail, probably much fuller than usual due to the heavy rains this year.

We found mushrooms upon mushrooms again! This year, robably because of the wet conditions, has been perfect for them. They are just popping up everywhere you look! The first ones we found were a whole colony of yellow-orange coral fungus. After that, many other different types. At one point early on I noticed an open ledge that looked like it might be a good starting place for a trail. I din't find one there, but I did find some interesting mushrooms there, including one that heaved up all the lichen around it as it grew skyward. Pretty impressive!

After I joined Rich again on the trail, I starting walking while he was photographing another mushroom. I soon saw movement off the side of the trail, a little wiggly tail. A snake!!! Finally another snake! It was a beautiful small garter snake with a checkered pattern, very similar to the one we saw along the Jesup Path last week. So beautiful. He was not hanging around to pose, though. He slithered off so quickly, up and over a log and out of sight in a second.

We continued on, making our way toward Breakneck Ponds, and I found a definite sign of a path leading off to teh west. i folowed this clear path and once into the woods and onto the ledge, the cairns started to appear. I followed them a short distance, enough to mark their positions and create a short tracklog to see the direction in which I was going, and then turned back. I would rather explore this with Rich next year!

We continued on along the road, which was descending now toward the ponds, and included some nice slickrock sections that we always used to love to ride our bikes over. Just past them, the road was very washed out and basically down inside adeep gully with smaller rocks underfoot. It was at this point, quite close to the southernmost pond, tht I fund a junction with a trail that I supect would take us up to Youngs Mountain.

Just like I had done with teh first trail (which might take us to McFarland? Not sure) I followed this trail a short distance. Just a hundred yards or so into the woods I saw ajunction with another trail that led off to the right. I stayed straight. I expect based on the old maps that there is another intersection further on, at which I would have to go right to Youngs or left to McFarlands, but I dont think I could have gotten to that point. So I wonder what that first junction was? I've marked the spot t invesitgate next time.

I joined Rich again on the road where hw was crossing the rather dicey spot (now, with high water) between the two ponds. He made it trough without incident and we continued on. Very soon we were at the point where we could have walked a few yards and gotten on the carriage roads for our return hike, but instead Rich suggested walking up further to the connector trail we used two days ago so I would be able to get a complete track of the road. We did that; it was less than another half mile.

We only saw two peopel on the BReajneck road, a man and woman walking with their (leashed) dogs who asked if we were lost. I don't knwo if they asked becase we were on Breakneck Road to begin with, or because we were wandering around the woods. I told them no, we were just looking for things to photograph like mushrooms and snakes. 

We were getting hungry so once we crossed onto the carriage roads, we stopped for a small snack of (traumatized?) tangerine juice and the remaining cookie from yesterday's lunch. We continued on and checked out the pitcher plants in the small pond. I didn't see them in halfmoon pond, nor did I see hte baby turle I saw last week. We did see a larger turtle sunning himself on a rock or log in Halfmoon pond.

The only other critter we saw was afrog in a culvert along the carriage roads not too far from our endpoint at Eagle Lake Road. We retuend to the car and took our remaining snack (croissant and blueberry hand pie) to a rock at Eagle Lake, right at hts point where the carriaage road is closed for construction and storm damage repair, to enjoy them before heading back to town.

As has become customary in recent years, our last night's dinner was at Havana. I had made reservations over a week ago because they were already filling up. We were happy to take the first reservation when they opened at 4pm. We started with two mojitos, as always, and the amuse bouche was a small cucumber slice topped with dill cream sauce and halibut. Like last week, the breads were the multigrain and blueberry cornbread, served with the cinnamon-honey-chive butter, chili oil, and black bean paste.

We wanted something a little different and lighter today, so we opted for two appetizers and one entrée that we split. The appetizers were the mushroom spring rolls, served with aioli and soy glaze, that are one of our long-tie favorites, and for something a little differnet this time we tried the cheese board. Wow, that was enough for 4 people! Everything was excellent. they brought out a Great Hill blue cheese, brie, cheddar, and tomme, served with crackers and crisps, grapes, strawberries, apple slices, golden raisins, and dried apricots.

We were already feeling a bit stuffed when our entree came out - but it was so delicious and easy to eat, we had no problem finishing it. We got the filet with mushroom sauce, roasted brussels sprouts, herbed toast, and corn cake. We were way too stuffed for a solid dessert, but we were interested in te "Havana Martini" ("that's Havana as in teh restaurant, not Havana as in Cuba.") We each got one and really enjoyed it. Lime juice, pineapple juice, and Cuban rum served with a pineapple wedge. R thought he might have enough room for a small ice cream cone but when we walkec over to MDI Ice Cream we discovered (actually I just remembered) that they're closed on Mondays. With adistinct chill in the air already, we came back to the room to enjoy a small glass of wine while I wrote up my notes for the day.
