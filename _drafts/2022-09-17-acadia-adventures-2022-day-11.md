"In an octopus's garden ...!"

After a large meal last night, we were in the mood for someting light. I completely forgot that it was Satuday so we could have visited the Flowered Aprn for some breakfast and trail treats! So instead we went to A Slice of Eden, which was still excellent. We just got a simple croissant sandwich with ham and cheese, and a salt & pepper bagel with olive-pimiento cream cheese for me. Coffee and jasmine tea. It was just the perfect amount to start our day. On the way back to our room we watched some heavy equipment operators felling some trees linng the Black Friar's parking lot. We assumed it's probably something the new owners of the adjacent property are having done.

I was really interested in going back to the Lake Wood/Fawn Pond area to check out the road I found last year and see if by some chance we could make the connection to Breakneck Road. Rich was interested too so we headed to the Lake Wood parking area (somewhat hidden jus toff the Crooked Road) and found the place deserted, just the way we like it. 

We headed directly for Fawn Pond, following last year;s tracklog on the GPS. It was an easy and quick hike now that we know the way, and the short section of trail right along the shoreline of Lake Wood was dry, unlike last year. We did some trail clearing (lots of fallen/blown down branches and small trees) along the steep climb up to Fawn Pond. Once at the shore, we took a few photos and spotted two frogs before continuing on to skirt Fawn Pond along its southern edge. 

The trail is mostly easy to follow - not obvious to the degree of, for example, the Redfield Hill trail, but still very evident to anyone who knows how to follow a trail that people have walked here before. We still made some small cairns (and I always keep my electronic cairsn in my GPS!) along the way to mark a few tricky turns.

Soon we came to an obvious old road that I had marked last year (And it was my turnaround point, as I was running the trail and Rich was waiting for me back at the west end of Fawn Pond). We first turned left and walked north toward the pond. I ran the shoreline path to see if I coud connect wit he shoreline path we'd hiked last year on the north side, but came to a high rocky amphitheater and alhouhg I could have picked y way through or tried going up on top, I didn't see much value in that. So I turned back, and Rich and I continued following the wide road in the other direction, south, and uphill. In another 2/10 of a mile or so, we came to another road that we suspected was the one that would lead down to Breakneck road. The road led in that direction, but it also led west, toward (we're assuming) Lake Wood.

It was around this time that Rich became pretty convinced that this was the road he had ridden so many years ago on his bike, up from Breakneck Road. He had been ridin Breakneck one day when he spotted this rather obvious (at the time) junction and turned onto it, and followed the road to Lake Wood. He had mentioned it to me many times over the years, but we had never managed to locate it. (It is much better cncealed now, even more so this year than last year when I spotted it from Breakneck and hiked up a short way to make a tracklog for later investigation.) But today, walking along tis very wide, moss covered old road, he and I both became convinced that it was the road!

Although we didn't plan on trying to follow it all the way to Lake Wood today, just making the connection with Breakneck would be enough evidence for us to be quite sure. And after a downhill hike over mostly easy terrain (but a very rocky, possibly recently washed out section) we made the conection and were standing on Breakneck Road! This was so exciting!

There was no good way to make this a loop hike, so we walked back the way we had come. On the way back we reminisced about his mountain biking and finding this road so many years ago. I looked for evidence of the Fawm Pond trail leading down toward Breakneck Ponds that supposedly contains an  old set of steps, but I dind't see anything all that promising. 

When we got back to the point where we would turn east to head toward Fawn Pond, I went a bit further to make a tracklog for the road segment that we suspect is the one that leads to Lake Wood. While there, I also spotted a well-worn trail leading off to the southwest that will also require investigation!

We were so hungry by the time we came back that we couldn't resist a small snack of the Lamb Chopper cheese and garlic-thyme Firehook crackers we bought last night. We only had a few bites but it really hit the spot. We rested for a little while longer, all the while debating whether we should got for pizza, or go back to Ciao. It was a hard decision! But we realized that Ciao isn't open tomorrow but Rosalie's is, so if we went to Ciao tonigth we could still go for pizza tomorrow.

It turned out to be a great decision. We waited by the door for about 20 minutes for them to open. We wanted to be the first ones there so we could get our favorite table by the window, and we had no trouble doing that. We were actually the only ones there right at 4:30, although another couple showed up a few minutes later, and others trickled in after that. Somehow the place generally remains quiet and it's still possible for us to hear each other talking, whic doens't really happen in other restaurants these days.

The food, as always, was fantastic. The menu was quite similar to last week's but there were some significant changes. We both wanted to get our own bowl of the crab soup ("Moose-minds!") so we did that and the soup was as delicious as last time. I oculd eat the whole pot! Then we got the octopus crostini (I had to try it) and the grilled romaine with marinated olives and feta and balsamic glaze. I actually had a dream last night tht I went there for the octopus and they were out of it, and I was very distraught. But no, in reality they still had it and it was awesome! I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't chewy or fishy at all. Just a sweet fresh flavor and extremely tender meat. It was served in a salad with peppers and adhered to the crostini with saffron aioli. The grilled romaine was similar to a dish my mother used to make, although hers was stuffed with blue cheese. It was served with the same delicious marinated olives that R went crazy over last itme. So awesome! And our final course was a duck ragout - kind of like a stew with a rich broth and carrots, and topped with a polenta cake. Extremely umami-y and comforting. We were thining about skipping dessert and maybe heading over for an ice cream cone later, but the pots de creme (chocolate-espresso with sea salt) sounded very appealing and we got one to share ("this way we don't have to go for ice cream!")
