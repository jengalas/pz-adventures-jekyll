Breakfast this morning (M00seversary breakfast!) was from Mount Dessert Bakery again. Tea and coffee, egg, Swiss cheese, and ham sandwiches on English muffins, and a croissant and two blueberry hand pies for later. We ate on our balcony while trying to figure out what was happening with the strange people who aparently had stayed next door last night (although we never saw or heard them, and they never parked in the parking spot). It seemed that they had such a huge truck (RAM Hemi, arrrrr, tiny dick) that it wouldn't fit in the spot and they parked in the other lot. At least I appreciate that they didn't try to "ram" it in there anyway. The sandwiches were very tasty although I think they were made on homemade English muffins that were a lot larger and thicker than I was expecting, so the sandwiches as a whole were more filling than we really wanted. I would try the same combination on a croissant.

Our plan for today, which was supposed to be cool and heavily overcast, was to go back to the Witch Hole Pond area for some photography. I was hoping to see some interesting plants and maybe even critters (snakes?!). It's always a pretty area, no matter what. 

This isn't an easy area to reach by bus, so we decided to drive like we did last time and park at the PAradise Hill Overlook. We were lucky to get an end spot (again, like last year) and we took a quick walk down the busy road to the "shortcut" entrance to the Witch Hole Pond-area carriage roads. This is one great advantage to kowing about these old, abandoned, and/or phantom trails - they allow easier access to certain areas (in some cases much easier) than any of the official roads or trails. If it weren't for this trail, which is quite pretty in its own right, it would require a long walk up a very steep and not terribly interesting hill from the visitors center to access these carriage roads.

We walked slowly, taking care to look for any interesting mushrooms and plants along our way, evn on the trail in to the carriage roads. We saw afew mushrooms but nt much else, as it has apparently been a dry year and most of the plants are looking water-stressed or otherwise past their prime. Near the end of the trail, not far from where it intersects with the carraige roads, i spotted someting springing around in the grass.  A beautifully patterned pickerel frog! I followed him around for a few minutes and was eventually able to get a few decent photos. 

We spent the rest of the morning exploring, slowly and in detail, a small area along the western side of Witch Hole Pond. We found some more mushrooms and quite a few more frogs, and some hatched turtle eggs (sadly, no turtles or snakes today). It was a perfect day for photography with some sun peeking through earlier in the day, and a cooler breeze and darker, misty conditions settling in later. 

We returned to our room around 2:30pm. I took a walk up to the Island Place next door, where my father is staying, to find that he had just arrived. We talked for a few minutes as he got his things arranged. The fog was turning to mist, and it was chilly. 

Rosalie's was SO crazy tonight. Every table was filled, upstairs and down, and there were people milling around waiting for an empty table. Never saw it like that in my life; so strange for a random Tuesday! Maybe because it was cool and misting heavly outisde, everyone came for an early supper? I have no idea. We arrived around 4:40 and the place was already nearly full. It was loud, although fortunately the table for 8 near us wasn't too bad. We got a large pizza, half with "peps" and half with extra onions. It was great, as always! And three large Allagash Whites made it even better. It was stil cool and misty when we walked back through town. Rich and Dad both swiped some cookies from the lobby. They'll make for good trail snacks!
