With the possibility of today being a rain day, with storms to come in the evening, our plans remained flexible at all times. Which means that we really had no idea where we were going to go or what we were going to do until we were there and doing it!

Dad was looking for some crepes for breakfast (no surprise!) so we took a walk through the wind down to the pier, where we were happy to find that Sunrise wasn't too busy. We were able to get the corner table overlooking the whale watch pier - no whale watches today, I guess because of the wind. We noticed that there are size tables outside that we could use on a warmer, calmer day. 

We had our usual crepes today, veggie for R, blueberry for me, and strawberry-banana-nutella for Dad. Everything was excellent! They both had coffee and I had tea (Constant Comment this time). The place became veyr busy, but I think as usual most people were just getting coffee and treats to go, and a few people were sitting at the outside tables in spite of the wind.

Walking back through town, it began to sprinkle as we looked at the menus for Galyn's and Testa's (Testes) and noticed that Jeannie's was completly full (as usual) and that they now have a few tables outside, in the small galleria where people wait in line to be served.

The rain was mostly light, on and off, throughout the early morning while we got ready for our hike, which again we didn't really know if we were doing anything until the last minute. We decided to take the bus to Sieur de Monts and from there, wait for the Park Loop Road bus and ride the loop if it was still raining. There was a heavy shower while we waited, but then it began to clear up as we talked to a man from San Francisco. By the time the bus arrived it was looking a bit brighter, and because no one got off the bus tere was really only room for the California couple anyway. So we passed on the bus ride and headed back toward the trails.

The Wild Gardens were open today, so Rich and I wanted to wander through (Dad had already checked it out while we were waiting for the bus). They are undergoing repairs from the wild storms we've had recently, but they had it set up really nicely with arrows guiding us through a portion of the gardens while the rest of the exhibits are being worked on. There wasn't too much in flower, but there were a few straggly cardinal flowers, some turtleheads, and fall flowers like asters and ragweed. We checked the wet areas (still high water) for frogs, and eventually found one, too far away to photograph. Jack-in-the-pulpit was in fruit, very abundant, and some of the plants were HUGE! I've never seen any that large before, very impressive. Too bad that many of them were flattened by the storm damage.

After the gardens, we joined Dad again at the field behind the gift shop, where Rich had seen some activity going on the other day (we're not sure what, maybe some kind of surveying or ground penetrating radar survey?). Walking east we hiked slowly along the Jesup Path's boardwalk section. It was still windy but the high canopy prevented us from feeling it, and it was very peaceful and quiet along the path. It was also, probably due to the morning weather conditions, much less busy on the trail than it was on Saturday. Lighting conditions were overcast and good for photographs, although we didn't see any wildlife. The fall colors are amazing along this trail and in the meadow nearby! It was ashock to see them because there has never been much color when we're here in September. It certainly wasn't a dry year, so I don't know why the leaves might be changing color earlier than normal. I looked for snakes the whole walk, but dind't see any today.

Emerging from the Jesup boardwalk, we had a choice of trails. It took a minute of checking out the map, but we eventually decided to take the Hemlock Road out to the Park Loop Road, cross over and continue on the Great Meadow loop (the eastern section) all the way around to Spring Street, which we followed back into town. This section was complete peace and solitude as we din't see a single other person the whole way. Interestingly, I learned later from Pathmakers that the Hemlock Road was Dorr's original entrance road to the park, and at the time he called it the Spring Road. I wondered if it might have been at one time a continuation of Spring Street, with which it is roughly in line to the north. It culd also be a concidence, since I'm sure there are a number of springs in the area - or the name may have had a completely different derivation.

Whilw we were on the eastern portion of the Great Meadow loop, R found a golf ball and kept trying to throw it at Dad's feet so he would think it came from the course (or from the heavens, or whatever) but he didn't notice it. Eventually we had to just bounce it over to him. 

It was still windy but felt much warmer at this point. Dad and I walked down to Mount Dessert Bakery for a few afternoon treats to tide us over. We bought lemon square, coffeecake slice, and a slice of pumpkin bread with chocolate chips, which we ate on the porch. All excellent! 

After some resting and working on photos, it was time for more food!  (Remember the  prideful pastor, calling his parking spot #1!) We went to Side Street Cafe again, where of course I had my usual Juice beer and lobster roll. Rich had a haddock sandwich with tomato, lettuce, and red onion on a potato roll, and dad had the MDI fish tacos, with slaw and avocado, rice and beans. All excellent again! We were too stuffed for dessert ... all except for Dad, who, after some poking around in Cadillac Mountain Sports and the Rock and Art shop, went for peach ice cream from MDI ice cream. The rock and art shop is always fun, although it's a lot smaller in its new location than it used to be. I talked to the girl working there about flytraps and airplants and she seemed veyr enthusiastic and surprisingly knowledgeable.

Restful night, tired!
