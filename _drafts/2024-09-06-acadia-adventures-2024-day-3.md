Today was a day for resting and catching up, or at least that's what Rich and I both had in mind when we woke up this morning. Still stuffed after huge lobster rolls and pizza yesterday, we picked up a few items from the hotel lobby for a very light breakfast this morning, which we ate on the porch as usual.

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery1" class="2by2" %}

A gentle stroll into town brought us past a place we've never noticed before, The Loft, that has sushi and poke on the menu and looks intriguing. (It also seems to be connected in some way to Testa's downstairs, but we'll try to find out more about that). We also located the Traveling Lobster micro-cafe that Constance mentioned to us yesterday when we checked in. Although we almost never eat lunch on vacation, it could be a good spot to get a lobster roll and sit in the park on a lazy day.

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery2" class="" %}

Speaking of lunch, well, today we ended up getting some lunch (or maybe more like second breakfast, since it was only around 9:45am). I wanted to check out the Sunrise Cafe to make sure they were still in business, and Rich said "let's see what it looks like, and if it's not busy, we'll get a veggie lover's crepe."

Although there was a line of about 5 people waiting for coffee and pastries (probably mostly people who were going on the whale watching tour) only one table was occupied, so we decided to go for it. The veggie crepe came out after a short wait, and it was incredible! It may have been the best one yet. Full of lots of roasted red peppers and onions, and avocado and arugula. Just perfect.

The sun was beginning to peek out by this time, so we wandered down along the Shore Path to see how it looked after the two massively destructive storms this past winter. We only walked a short distance, and mostly everything looked OK, but I think this is the section that has received the most rehabilitation already. We noticed that a few of the very large slabs atop the seawall were shifted a bit ("should just take a little tweak to get them back into place!") and some recently-placed gravel had been washed out, probably by heavy rainstorms during the summer. We checked on the four benchmarks in the area, and all are still in place and in good condition.

I got some of my shopping done this morning, too. Although I had no luck finding new running shoes at Cadillac Mountain Sports (they were all sold out of my size), we bought several blueberry jams and syrup for Elaine and Donna at one of the Acadia Shops.

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery4" class="2by2" %}

We rested back at the room for about an hour, talking casually about what we might want to do for the afternoon. I mentioned wanting to check out the old Wildwood Farm road at some point, and we began looking at the maps and discussing how we might get there (bus, or drive?) and where we might park if we drove. We were initially thinking about doing it over the weekend, but then Rich suggested at least scouting it out this afternoon. Of course, I was up for it!

We decided to try driving, and seeing if we could park at Wildwood Stables and walk down Stable Lane toward the point where the old road should intersect it. This worked out well. We took Eagle Lake Road and then the Park Loops Road past Jordan Pond, and then turned left onto Stable Lane heading toward the stables. On the way, we passed the spot where the old road branched off. It wa quite obvious, and I even got a glimpse of the old stone bridge in the distance.

Continuing on, we easily found parking at the stables, and then headed into the woods. Just past the camping spot for "boarders only," we found an old road grade that we figured had also been part of the old Wildwood Farm Road, so we followed it down to Stable Lane. It was easy walking through peaceful and very pretty woods. Emerging on Stable Lane, we only had to walk another tenth of a mile west and then we came to the point where the old road turned off, heading southwest. The stone bridge, as well as a lengthy stacked stone retaining wall, was in front of us! Another gorgeous spot we've passed by so many times and yet had no idea it was here.

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery5" class="" %}

We followed the road beneath the echo-y bridge ("What's up, weirdos?!") and then another tenth of a mile or so to a point where a previous fill had obviously been washed out by a storm, flood, or some other extreme erosion event. I worked my way down the embankment and across the trickle of a creek. I wanted to see how far I could follow the road, although I assumed it was no more than yet another tenth of a mile to Jordan Pond Road.

This assumption was correct. The old road emerges onto Jordan Pond Road, which is basically a residential development that has nothing to do with the park. I couldn't see anywhere that the old road would have crossed, because directly across Jordan Pond Road from where it emerged, there was a 20-foot cliff. So I think that's the end of the old road for now. (It is possible that it continued at an angle and entered the woods again somewhere slightly off to one side, but I didn't see any sign of this today, and didn't want to spend the time today for a deeper search.) I marked a waypoint at the intersection, and then turned to head back and meet Rich at the washed-out area.

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery6" class="" %}

On the way back, I noticed a few things I had missed on my first pass by: an Acadia National Park bat monitoring station, and, as I was climbing back up the embankment on the other side, a granite boundary marker with an unstamped, unmarked disk set into it! So cool!

{% include tracklog.html %}

I kept hoping the entire time that we would have come across a snake. We didn't see any along the old road, but not 30 seconds after we were discussing the DOR snake we saw a few years ago on nearby Stanley Brook Road, Rich noticed and pointed out a DOR ring-necked snake, right in the middle of Stable Lane. The poor thing was flattened, with part of his orange belly showing, nearly flush with the pavement but still somewhat soft to the touch. Heartbreaking! He was a beautiful long snake, too, 12 to 14 inches, and vibrant. I wore my snake pendant to dinner tonight in honor and memory of the poor little snake we found, a bit too late.

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery7" class="" %}

We chose a new place for tonight's dinner, named, appropriately enough, Dinner. It has taken the place of one of our favorite restaurants from years past, Ciao, on Cottage Street. We were unsure whether to make reservations or if seating was first-come, first-served, so we figured we would just arrive a few minutes before opening time of 5:00pm and see what the story was. We were pleased to see that no one else seemed to be hanging around, and the waitress let us in a few minutes before 5:00, and gave us our favorite table for two in the front window. Dinner was off to a good start! Their menu is more traditional in the sense that they have appetizers and entrees, unlike Ciao which served a variety of small plates only. But the flavors were innovative and the ingredients fresh and changing by the week based on what is fresh locally, so the new place clearly follows in the footsteps of Ciao. We even noticed when our water glasses and, later, cocktails came out that they are using the same glasses that Ciao used.

Also like Ciao, they have a small menu of featured cocktails. I ordered a margarita and Rich got (to my surprise) a dirty martini with blue cheese-stuffed olives. Both were excellent, and Rich even liked the olives! Our appetizer was mojo shrimp - marinated and then grilled perfectly, six large shrimp. They came with a variety of sauces: poblano, mushroom, soy, and some pickled onions. Just amazing, and I could have eaten a dozen of them.

Our entrees were skirt steak with Colcannon potatoes and Swiss chard (chosen by Rich) and panko-crusted halibut with a kimchi sauce and greens for me. (Of course we shared our entrees, as we always do.) We loved every bite, and portions were large for the price. We were surprisingly hungry, so the large portions were actually much appreciated.

{% include gallery.html gallery_id="gallery8" class="" %}

Their dessert offerings (tiramisu and chocolate pots de creme) didn't excite us tonight, so we passed on them, and then took a walk to the park where we bought small sorbets from Mount Desert Ice Cream (my favorite blueberry basil, and sour cherry - also one of my favorites - for Rich.) We enjoyed our desserts while resting on a bench in the park, surrounded by screaming kids, and then walked back slowly, enjoying the scenery as it grew darker and chillier, and relished in the heat once we got back to the room.
