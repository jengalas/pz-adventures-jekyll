We were still full from last night's dinner, so breakfast this morning was exceptionally light: just one strawberry breakfast bar, split between us, and a tiny orange for me. We ate on the porch as usual, while discussing what we wanted to do today.

I've wanted to take Rich to see the Tilting Rock since I first found and followed the trail to it last year. It was a beautifully interesting and geologically intriguing area, and I knew he would like it. For some reason he was thinking that we had to access the area via the carriage roads, so he was understandably reluctant, since carriage road walks can be very long between access points. But when I showed him where it was and how we could access the area, he agreed that it could be a good activity for today!

There was only one other car in the Champlain Monument parking area when we arrived right at 10:00am. Of course, in the five minutes it took us to get our stuff together, three other cars came and parked and about 10 pulled off the road, looked around, and left.

Heading north on the Day Mountain Trail, we soon turned off to the right, onto the Old County Road, from which we would soon turn onto the path to Tilting Rock.

Darn it if we didn't follow the very obvious path to the right, making the same mistake I did last year! Although this path is well-worn, for some reason it doesn't really seem to go anywhere. I remember last year having to fight my way through messy woods until I eventually spotted a cairn and met up with the actual trail. On the way out last year, I followed the trail the entire way, and realized that I should have gone to the left right after turning off the Old County Road. I'm lucky that I remembered this and that I had a tracklog and a series of cairns as waypoints to follow this year. I certainly didn't want to fight my way through that again, or for Rich to have to deal with it.

Soon we were on the correct path again, following cairns, mostly the same as last year; some were new and others seemed to be gone or moved, and the occasional piece of orange flagging tape. We got confused in one other spot but easily rerouted ourselves. The ledges and small caves within the ledges were just as impressive as the first time I saw them! Rich liked the area very much too. And what a treat it was to round that last high ledge and see the Tilting Rock right in front of us!

Last year I didn't have much time to spend here, so I didn't actually go up close to the Tilting Rock and examine it. But this year I did, and in doing so, noticed a path continuing to the northeast. That made sense in hindsight: why else would there be a cairn right in front of the Tilting Rock, unless there was a path that passed by it, and didn't just terminate at it?

The path looked well-used so we followed it. After a short distance of easy walking, it took us to a T intersection! The path leading left from the T intersection will have to wait until next time. This time we went right, and as I suspected it took us back to the Old County Road! I had wanted to get a full tracklog of this old road anyway, so I we followed it down to Route 3. Then we reversed and went back uphill to follow it back toward where we had entered the trail to Tilting Rock.

Just before the intersection with that trail, we noticed another trail leading off in roughly the same direction. This is yet another trail that will need to be followed! Maybe it leads to the base of the ledges, the old seastacks? Not sure yet.

And then up came a trail that Rich noticed, leading off to the left. He was hoping we would find a trail leading down to the Champlain monument, and this one did! So cool. We finished our rather convoluted loop by taking the official trail from the monument back out to the Day Mountain trailhead.

We sat in the parking area for a few minutes to determine where to go next. We decided just to bum around the area, and check out Steamboat Wharf in Seal Harbor. Taking New County Road (apparently the other side, and the still-used section of the County Road) down to the wharf was very cool. It's a very narrow, switchbacking road that winds its way downhill toward the water, passing by lovely large estates that all have their own names, as so many in this area do. We're also thinking we may have seen the driveway/private road to Martha Stewart's summer house!

We stopped at Steamboat Wharf for the first time last year and thought it was a pretty and peaceful place with a nice view of Pemetic(?) Mountain. There aren't any tables or benches—it's really just a working dock, but we found seating along the edge of the pier that was comfortable enough for a few minutes' rest. 

Then we took a drive around Northeast Harbor, just to check out the restaurant Copita, which we would like to try sometime (just not this year). Our drive back to town was via Stanley Brook Road and through the park on the Loop Road.

All day long we had no idea where we wanted to go for supper, which is very unusual for us! Most days we've had a plan from the beginning, if not the day (or several days!) before. It wasn't until after today's adventures that we narrowed it down to two options: Siam Orchid, or Paddy's. I could tell that Rich really wanted a Guinness and a burger, and I could easily go for something like that too, so Paddy's it was.

We took a slow walk down to the waterfront and arrived there just after 4:00pm. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, and most of the customers that were there were eating outside, which we generally choose not to do. We were given a nice table for two in the back of the first dining room, with no one else nearby.

As planned we both ordered a pint of Guinness and Rich ordered the wood fired pub burger. My choice today was the fish tacos, which I've had before and were excellent and pretty light (notwithstanding the fact that the fish is fried). Our meals came out very quickly and everything was perfect. The burger wasn't too big and the proportions of meat to veggies and bun were spot on. The fish tacos were also excellent. The fish had a light and crispy batter that wasn't oily at all, and the toppings of avocado, roasted corn salsa, and chipotle crema were very good accompaniments. I really like their cole slaw, too, and I chose that for my side dish. It's creamy but not at all watery.

Although I like the blueberry pie at Paddy's (it is a unique take that is more like a tart than a traditional slice of pie), we decided to skip dessert there and see if we felt like having a small scoop of ice cream or sorbet later, after a brief walk around town.

On that walk around town, we wandered into a few of the Acadia Shops, and I found a t-shirt to bring home for my father's friend Lucy. I also found something that he will like, but I had to wait for confirmation on his shirt size, and he didn't reply to me until we were back in the room.

We were still in the mood for a tiny treat when we passed MDI Ice Cream, so we each got baby scoops: Callebaut chocolate for Rich, and blueberry basil sorbet for me. We sat on a bench in the strangely-not-busy park and enjoyed our dessert as a chilly wind began to whip around us. On the way back to our room, we stopped to check the hours for A Slice of Eden bakery, because we may want to get something there for breakfast tomorrow.
