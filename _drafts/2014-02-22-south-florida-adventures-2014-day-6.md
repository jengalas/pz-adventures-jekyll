Seaplane adventure day! We arrived early at the airport after having the Key Lime pie we purchased last night at Kermit's for breakfast. (As we said, you never know if the plane is going down, so have dessert first!) And we arrived to find that a large group of high school students had also booked the trip for this morning. They were split between the two planes; we were the only two not involved with that group. Our pilot was Evan, also a bush pilot in Alaska. He gave us a very smooth ride and a great tour as we flew over the reef and past tiny islands and shipwrecks visible in the shallow water of the Gulf. After a flight time of about 40 minutes we landed on the water near Garden Key and the plane backed onto the beach. 

I was amazed at the size of the fort, but of course, one of the first things I noticed were the prickly pear cactuses growing along the top of the fort! I can only assume seeds were deposited by birds flying over, maybe from Mexico.

We first explored the fort a bit and watched a new 3D video about the coral reef in the visitors center; we were a little disappointed that the gift shop wasn't yet open. We loved the dark stone spiral steps leading to the different levels of the fort although it took a while to find a set of steps that wasn't blocked off. Also remember the neat stalagmites and stalactites growing from the salt dripping through from the top level of the fort.

Eventually we found a staircase that would take us to the top. What an incredible view! We wandered around the top of the fort, taking photos of the lighthouse and the survey mark FORT on top of one of the ramparts. We got to see the prickly pears up close. A lizard was perched on top of one of them!

While walking along the wall surrounding the moat, we saw a fish eat a lizard that had just jumped into the water, found two Army Corps marks embedded in the walkway, and saw a saltwater crocodile swimming in the moat! We later named him Jefferson H. Crocodile III (Jeff for short)—all while the high school students were snorkeling nearby.

We had a few minutes to wade in the water, and it was wonderful! What could be better than bathtub-warm water, the gentlest of breezes, sun and beautiful colors everywhere?! It was over far too soon, and by 11:00am it was time to return to the plane.  I was able to grab the copilot's seat this time, so I had a great view the whole way. We saw a yellow-orange fish grab a snack and many, many sea turtles in the water below us!

Our lunch stop was Paseo's, the place whose tables we used yesterday to eat our breakfast from Old Town Bakery across the street. By noon Paseo's was very busy, and for good reason. Everything was insanely good, just like every other meal we've had here! We got their famous roasted corn with spices, cilantro, lime and cheese; a Caribbean pork sandwich and a fish sandwich, both with cilantro and grilled onions (the fish sandwich came with jalapenos as well).  The atmosphere was lively and we saw the same family of chickens we ate with yesterday morning. We then went back to Old Town Bakery to pick up a few raspberry croissants for the morning.

We walked past the Catholic church and were able to take some photos of the spires, which are both landmark stations (oddly enough). We also took some photos of the bonus FLDOT disk we had spotted across the street while on the conch train yesterday.

Our afternoon was spent relaxing at Fort Zachary Taylor State Park. We found a picnic bench in the shade. From the concession stand I bought a lime frozen fruit bar and some water, and Rich took a nap in the shade. I couldn't come up with anywhere nearby for supper, so we decided to try Pepe's again if we could find a parking spot downtown. I simply had to have the bread with sauces, and plantains again! And mojitos, of course. We enjoyed all of that and more—conch fritters and a combination platter of slow roasted pork, ground spiced beef, and slow roasted beef. It was all awesome, again!
