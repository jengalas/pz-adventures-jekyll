It was another perfectly clear, cool morning. It took us a little while to get moving again, and this time we decided to try a little something different for breakfast, even though we didn't want much to eat. Rich picked up the tea, coffee, and juice as usual from the lobby while I ran down to Mount Dessert Bakery to see what they were offering today. Our thoughts were plain croissants or, if those weren't available, plain bagels with veggie cream cheese. 

A line of about 8 people had already formed seven minutes after the bakery opened, but at least the line was moving quickly. I did not, however, see any plain croissants in the bakery case. But I asked about them when I got to the counter, and they did in fact have plain croissants—they had just come out of the oven. So we had delicious warm croissants for breakfast as we sat on the porch as usual.

We took some time to consider what to do today. Rich was feeling up for a bit of a hike, just probably not quite as much as hiking St. Saveur Mountain to look for an old survey pole would require. After going back and forth over a few different options, we decided to check out the old road on Beech Mountain that is featured in Matt Marchon's book (Vol. 2).

Driving past the parking pulloff for St. Saveur, we noted that it was empty around 10:30am—something to keep in mind for when we do that hike, if we do. We made our way onto Lurvey Spring Road and found the parking pulloff at the sharp curve as described in the book.

After a passing thought that we might look for the actual Lurvey Spring (coordinates for which I received from someone many years ago), we decided to save that for another day and instead began making our way up the old road. It was easy to follow the entire way, and quietly beautiful. 

Unsurprisingly, we were the only ones on the old road, and it was so nice to have the place to ourselves. There were a few steep spots particularly in areas that had suffered obvious water erosion, and quite a few blowdowns, some of which were very tricky to bypass. But overall it was an easier walk than expected, and next time (knowing now what to expect!) it should be even easier. We didn't see a single mushroom or fungus until we neared the top, but it seems to have been a dry year, so that is expected. The entire landscape is green here - mosses and lichens and conifers, and ferns here and there.

The road surface changes from soft spruce-needle-covered dirt to rocky slope to smooth bedrock and back and forth a few times, so there was variety the whole way. We found the stonework culvert (or whatever it is; no one seems to be sure) that was described in Marchon's book. And we eventually made our way to the top, where we came out from behind a wooden fence segment that was obviously set up to keep people on either the Canada Cliffs trail or the Valley Trail, and not wander down an unmarked path.

We chose the Valley Trail for the walk back. This is a relatively easy, beautiful trail that I think we've only hiked once before. After about a tenth of a mile from the intersection with Canada Cliffs (and the abandoned road), there is a series of small caves (also highlighted in Marchon's book) that we enjoyed exploring. We had never noticed them before.

The trail features lots of carved granite steps and some rolling "hills" ("Now I know what they mean by 'Uphill both ways!'") before popping out of the woods on the western side of Beech Mountain to a stunning view over Long Pond and the ocean. This area features two switchbacks down the side of the mountain, and at the point of one I noticed a trail heading off into the woods (well, along the ridge) to the northwest. I marked a point so we can come back and check it out.

When we reached the bottom, we had a pretty long walk ahead of us to get back to the car. But as we were passing what looked to be a parking pulloff on Lurvey Spring Road, we noticed what looked like yet another trail heading off into the woods. Curious if it might lead to the Valley Trail (and thus become a shortcut between that trail and Lurvey Spring Road), I ran it while Rich waited for a few minutes at the southern end. It did in fact meet up with the Valley Trail! It came to a small set of stone steps and was blocked by a few small logs - the kind of thing I would have noticed if I'd been looking for an old trail in that area, but I wasn't expecting one and didn't see it. In any case this will be a good addition to our trail map. <!--  (see OneNote for ideas about what these trails might be)  Trail from lower part of Valley Trail to Lurvey Spring Road (I think this may be the section referred to in Pathmakers #109, Beech Mtn South Ridge: "The section from the Valley Trail to Lurvey Spring is no longer marked."-->

Continuing on down Lurvey Spring Road, we passed a few other parking pulloffs (also good to know about) and a sign on a gate for Ben's Blueberry Patch. And soon after the blueberry patch we found two more Acadia boundary disks!

Once we returned to the car, we took a waypoint for the parking area and for the entrance to what we suspect is the trail to the campgrounds, right across the road from the spot where we parked.

As we were heading out, Rich asked if I had ever been to Echo Lake Beach. I hadn't, mostly because it's not so much the kind of thing that appeals to me when I'm here, and because he said it's usually packed with kids. But we figured we're here, so why not check it out? And the beach wasn't too busy today (granted, there was a very chilly wind coming across the lake). Only one guy was swimming, and he claimed the water wasn't too bad. But coming out into the cold wind after swimming probably was!

We only hung out there for about 10 minutes, and then drove to the end of the parking area to see if we could find the trailhead for the Beech Cliffs Ladder Trail. It's there, right at the end of the parking lot. Neither of us has done this trail before, but I've had it on my list for a long time. Maybe we will get a chance to do it one day, but not today. It was already getting late in the afternoon, and we were getting hungry. Dinner would come soon, after some time to rest and clean up in the room.

In the mood for a moderately-sized meal for dinner, and because Rich had been dying to try their stuffed cabbage ever since he saw it on the menu a few days ago, we headed to the Black Friar right around 4:30. Happy hour was underway, so we got two blueberry gin cocktails to start off the evening. They were very light and refreshing - similar to yesterday's blackberry gin & tonic, I probably could have enjoyed a few of these (and then not known what hit me). 

Crabcakes sounded like a tasty and relatively light appetizer, and they were excellent. Lots of crab meat, no fillers, and they came with a roasted red pepper salsa and some corn kernels and arugula lightly dressed with a vinegar dressing. Delicious.

Our entrees were, of course, the stuffed cabbage for Rich and the Atlantic char for me. We had no idea what to expect from the cabbage. It's one of those dishes that everyone makes differently, and everyone typically has an attachment to the way they grew up eating them, so it can be very hit or miss when trying someone else's version or ordering from a restaurant. But these were beyond spectacular! They were stuffed with a lamb and onion filling (the lamb originated from Sunset Acres Farm) and covered with a thick, chunky, but very plain tomato sauce, and a light sprinkling of parmesan cheese. There was something about the filling (the lamb, I assume) that lent an incredibly unusual note that perfectly matched the tart umami of the tomato sauce. Could not have asked for anything better! 

The Atlantic char was also fantastic. It was, as far as I know, the first time either of us has had it. It looks like salmon, but doesn't really taste like it. Has a lighter flavor but still nice and flaky and a bit oily. The fish came with perfectly cooked green beans and jasmine rice with a light lemon sauce with capers. And then, because we had just a bit of room left, we had a slice of NY cheesecake with a delicious wild blueberry sauce on top. The wild blueberries were just incredible as well. How I wish we could get them at home!
