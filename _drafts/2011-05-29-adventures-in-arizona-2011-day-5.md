Biosphere 2! Remember Rs interest in the rainforest, which we did eventually get to see. Awesome "lung" (one of two) that equalizes press inside the biosphere so the glass panels don't explode or implode. Bug experiment going on now to compare populations of bsckswimmers and water striders, which apparently I am! Lemons and bananas still growing on trees, but farm area is gone. bush babies were living there with people because it was thought they would be good companions but it turned out that since bush babies are nocturnal they almost never interacted with the people.  Bush babies are now "gone" but the guide didnt say what happened to them.  (remember to look up the memoir About living in the biospere by Jayne pointer). Right after talking extensively with the guide about survey marks (she didn't know of any in the area, and we couldn't find the guy she directed us to) we checked out the "ocean" from the bottom and saw some newt fish including the yellow tang (the fishdom fish!) and neat royal bie fish with bright neon yellow tails, we also saw the living quarters/apartments. Bought prickly pear honey in the gift shop. Try to recall idea for novel about being stuck in the biosphere! 

Tohono chul park: baby birds and eggs in cactus pot, huge mission cactus with woody stem. Quails that were scared away by dives and a big male "javelina".  As is becoming the theme her we still could not find any silver charms in the gift shop.

RA Sushi for supper, which we had noticed in the la encantada mall on our first night when we went for frost gelato.  We started with lobster spring rolls and then pigged out on shrimp tempura roll, seared tuna tapas plate, tropical roll with shrimp, cucumber, mango salsa and sriracha sauce (which we both agree was the best), Halibut nigiri (which we would have loved more of) beef tatami roll and 4peaks kilt lifter. I think this is also where i discovered that 4peaks is in Phoenix and put it on the list for the second half of our trip.
