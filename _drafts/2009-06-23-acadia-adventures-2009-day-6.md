Scrambled eggs, toast, cranberry juice; Eggs Benedict (medium fried, crispy bacon), home fries, coffee (R) at Jeannie's; small sausage, mushroom & onion pizza, Export Ale (Rosalie's); blueberry basil sorbet at MDI Ice Cream.

Rain again.  Breakfast at Jeannie's, then checked out the harbor. We found an unattended GPS station in use over the tidal station on the pier, but we couldn't find anyone nearby who seemed to be the one in charge of it.  We bought two moose puzzles at Sherman's because we knew we'd be needing them for the rest of the week if it was going to continue raining!  We found out the name of the park in town (Agamont) that we'd been wondering about all year, and trying in vain to discover through webcams and Google Street View.  Next, we spent some time at the library looking through the _Pathmakers_ book.  We spent most of the rest of the day working on the puzzle; we went back to Sherman's before supper to find a large foam board on which to assemble our puzzles.  Then we went for pizza, and afterward checked again for the GPS station, but by now it was gone.
