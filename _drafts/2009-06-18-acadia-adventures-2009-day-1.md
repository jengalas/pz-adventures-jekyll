Summary: RAIN!!!

Snacks: nut mix, Swedish fish ("two fish!"), cran-pomegranate juice; bagel with veggie cream cheese, pineapple juice; vegetable chowder and potato pancakes with sour cream, coffee (R.) at Rein's.

Left at 6:30pm.  Rain the entire way. Got to Rein's around 10:15 after getting slightly lost (took wrong turn at double exit).  More rain the whole way and overnight at the rest area -- slept from 2:00-5:00 and woke up to even more pouring rain.
