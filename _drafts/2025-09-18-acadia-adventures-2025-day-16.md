Quick breakfast of oats and blueberry muffin while it rained lightly. 

I finally had a chance to talk with Christopher before we left - while I checked out. He asked how and when we had been making our reservations, and I told him that we typically email the owner in December/January to request the room for the dates that we choose. He wanted to make sure we were getting the best possible rate, which he looked into and said that we were. He also said that we could reserve by calling him directly ("No, I'm not here in January, are you crazy?! But even if you waited until April I would still be able to give you Room 3.") That was good to know.

I also suggested that they might want to replace the tiny patio tables with something a little bigger, especially because they are now serving breakfast and people would like a more comfortable place to eat it. (I gave as an example the German/Autrian couple in the room next to us who knocked their drink off the table a few days before - figuring they would also have liked more room!). Christopher said that no way would they be able to replace all of the tables, but that he would be happy to order a larger table for us. Just call him a few weeks before our arrival and he will get one ordered.

Fortunately the rain ended quickly. We left at 8:40 and had for once a relatively smooth drive home, just two areas of slow traffic near NH border and near Worcester. Didn't take long at all to get through them. Stopped at the last rest area in Maine as usual and got a "crispy" chicken sandwich from Burger King and a coffee from Dunkin (next time get a small - the medium was pretty big). That was just after noon. Got back on the road around 12:40 and were home by 6:40. Weather was partly cloudy in Maine, sunny and very warm everywhere else. 

It was such a treat to come home to a delicious extra sausage small pizza from Rosalie's! Tonight we baked it on the pizza tray in a 350 degree oven. It was great because we were so hungry! But the next day we heated our small house veggie pizza on a preheated pizza stone, and that was even better.
