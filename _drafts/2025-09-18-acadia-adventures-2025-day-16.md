Quick breakfast of oats and blueberry muffin while it rained lightly. Fortunately that ended quickly. We left at 8:40 and had for once a relatively smooth drive home, just two areas of slow traffic near NH border and near Worcester. Didn't take long at all to get through them. Stopped at the last rest area in Maine as usual and got a "crispy" chicken sandwich from Burger King and a coffee from Dunkin (next time get a small - the medium was pretty big). That was just after noon. Got back on the road around 12:40 and were home by 6:40. Weather was partly cloudy in Maine, sunny and very warm everywhere else.
