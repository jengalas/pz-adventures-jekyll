We started the day (which began warm and quickly got _so_ warm that we were overdressed by breakfast time) with pastries from Morning Glory again.  (Blueberry streusel and sticky bun for dad, blueberry cheese danish for me, toast with spicy cilantro cream cheese for R, rhubarb cheese danish for mom). We took a quick walk on part of the Shore Trail as we waited for mom to head off to the lighthouse tour that we had booked for her last night.  R and I showed some of the benchmarks along the way, of course.  Mom headed off to her tour and we prepared for our hike.  We had decided to hike the Perpendicular Trail on Mansell Mtn because it's such a great example of stonework that we wanted dad to see.  Our choice for the return trail was the Razorback.  Everything went as planned.  The weather was alternately overcast, sunny, and breezy, but overall very pleasant.  We took plenty of breaks on the way up and tried taking several video clips to show the winding structure of the trail.  Once at the top, the configuration of trail intersections wasn't quite as I had expected it to appear, but we trusted the map and our reading of it, and after a descent into a ravine and a climb back up a bare ledge, we were at the beginning of the Razorback Trail.  Quite a contrast to the Mansell Mtn trail that completed our loop last time, Razorback almost exclusively follows open ledges for the first half of the hike, if not more.  Only toward the end did we drop into deep rooty woods where we had to basically walk straight downward. In order to reach the Cold Brook trail we hiked about a tenth of a mile on the Gilley Trail and then met up with Cold Brook.  It was here that those first few drops of rain that dad had felt, so slight that he wasn't even sure they were rain, grew to a more obvious shower.  We were mostly under cover all along the level, wooded Cold Brook trail, though, so we barely got wet.  The showers let up as we drove back north, and in Bar Harbor it hadn't rained at all.  Mom was back with many stories from her lighthouse tour, which she thoroughly enjoyed.  She even got a nice photo of the Egg Rock lighthouse for us and will be a guest contributor when I write up the survey mark page for that station.

We relaxed for the rest of the afternoon (well, dad went to the Hannaford, apparently, for fig bars and nuts).  Then spent some time in SW Harbor in the Sawyer's Specialties shops buying wine, tea, and cheese (cheddar for mom, Olga for us).

Dinner at Red Sky: R and I shared oyster chowder and mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette, cranberries and blue cheese. Dad had crispy polenta with mushrooms and mom also had the salad.  R had Bug Lager to drink and the rest of us had the New Guy IPA. Mom and I both had the sauteed sole in citrus butter sauce (with potatoes and carrot slaw), R had the cannelloni stuffed with mushrooms and zucchini, and dad had the half chicken that I had on Sunday night.  For dessert, we shared the large cheese plate (Camembert, a Tomme, a Vermont cheddar, and Fuzzy Udder blue(?).
