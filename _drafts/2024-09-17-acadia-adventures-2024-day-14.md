Today was the rest day that Rich has been waiting for! I went for my breakfast run to A Slice of Eden, where I picked up an egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant for Rich, and a strawberry danish (that was much larger than I expected) for myself. I almost always get a bagel there, but wasn't in the mood for something so big and heavy this morning. (I ended up saving about half of the danish for later.)

After breakfast we discussed a few options for today's activities, including checking out the Quarry Trail or going back to the Cooksey Drive Overlook that we found for the first time last year. We instead landed on checking out the Shore Path from the far end, curious to see how far the reconstruction of the path has come since the severe damage it received over the winter from two back-to-back storms.

We walked over on Ledgelawn Avenue, stopping along the way to check out the interior of what we've been calling the "Lego Church" for several years now since it's been under construction. The church was nearly empty, aside from a custodian cleaning up between the pews. Rich took a few photos while I noticed a statue of a nun off to the side (watching him!). I learned that it was Sister Katharine Drexel, who was the sister in law of Edward Morrell, who has a statue near Jackson Lab and donated land to the town for a park. (See notes from 2022 and 2023.)

Continuing on, we went down Pleasant Street and then crossed over by Havana, following Wayman Lane down to the end of the Shore Path. Although the "trail closed" barrier we had passed was pushed to the side, as soon as the path was within sight, we could tell that it wasn't in any way passable. Work was underway, with large pieces of rebar and stone lying out in the open and gaping gullies on the trail surface.

A pleasant man was stationed at the end of the trail, and for the time being his job seemed to be to turn the tourists away. He explained just how bad the storms were, and said that the trail reconstruction was really only complete up to Grant Park, several blocks to the north. They hope to have it completed by next season, but it's a big job, money and the season are short, and they are of course at the mercy of whatever storms next winter will bring. But the man, a local old-timer, sounded hopeful. We thanked him for his time and turned around.

We ended up checking out Grant Park, which we came to this time from Main Street (we've only seen it before from the Shore Path side). It's nothing exciting - just some greenspace and a few picnic tables and benches adjacent to the Shore Path. But it was a very peaceful place to sit and rest and chat for a while. We also saw the Balance Rock Inn on the way to the park. I was never quite sure where that was.

It was a hot day with very bright sunlight, and I was feeling very toasty after sitting for a while. So with a huge (3660 passenger) cruise ship looming in the harbor, we headed over into town so I could finish up my shopping.

That was as crazy as you would expect. The sidewalks were packed to the point you could barely move. I did purchase the golf shirt and another t-shirt for my father that I'd had my eye on yesterday, and we took a brief walk through Cadillac Mountain Sports, but that was about all we could tolerate. I couldn't stand the crowds and Rich was feeling wiped out from the heat, so we just went back to the room and spent the rest of the early afternoon reading, researching, and drinking lemonade on the porch.

When Rich went inside to take a shower, I decided to go back into town to pick up a few more items. Instead of dealing with the crowds on lower Main Street and Cottage Street, instead I took the shortcut through the cemetery (checking on Lucreatia along the way) and went down Firefly Lane directly to the tea shop and the two adjacent Acadia Park shops, where I picked up the remaining items I had on my mental list.

Tonight's dinner at Brasserie le Brun was worth the week-long wait! I had been looking forward to their food and particularly getting another "Death in the Afternoon" cocktail for a few days now, and it didn't disappoint. As usual, we were at the door for their 4:00pm opening. We were seated at the front window table so we had plenty of room and a nice view of the new Pathmaker hotel, still under construction. 

Feeling extra hungry after our long walk and the hot day (and a very light breakfast) we decided to order two appetizers. But first, out came our cocktails (we both got Death in the Afternoon) and some freshly baked bread with chive butter. The bread had some pieces of roasted garlic baked into it, which was a nice touch.

Then came the appetizers: escargot, which Rich has wanted me to try for a long time. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I loved it! This was served quite differently from the way he's had it in the past, though. He had it served simply with melted garlic butter. This was instead served with absinthe(!) garlic butter inside a pastry shell. The texture of the snails was like a firm mushroom, not really chewy, and not slimy at all. Just very unusual in a good way; a very tasty combination.

Our second appetizer was tuna tartare, which I knew I would like. The amount of meat was far beyond what I expected, and it was tender and delicious served on top of thinly-sliced melon, with lardons on top, and chili oil and aioli on the side.

The appetizers were actually very filling, and I was starting to worry that I wouldn't have room to finish the entree! But not to worry ... even though it was large, it was so good that I had no trouble finishing every bite. Just needed to take it slow. 

I ordered the same thing I had last time: filet mignon au poivre with fingerling potatoes and sherry cream sauce. I was so tempted by the halibut, but I just couldn't resist getting the beef and potatoes one more time. Rich tried the short rib bourguignon this time, and it was spectacular! We were expecting more of a stew with cubes of meat, but it was the whole short rib, falling-apart tender, in a velvety savory sauce, and served with lardons and roasted onions, carrots, and king trumpet mushrooms. We shared our entrees as usual, and every bite was perfect.

Somehow, we had a little bit of room left to share a dessert. We chose one we were considering last time, the stonefruit shortcake. It was fortunately very light: just three small biscuits and a compote of peaches and another fruit we're not sure of - maybe nectarines? Very tasty end to a perfect meal.

We spent the rest of the evening watching a few videos and reading (and researching local trails!) before bed.
