How dissimilar could blueberry festivals possibly be? The Montrose (PA) and Ellenville (NY) blueberry festivals were only a week and a hundred miles apart, but they were different worlds entirely.

I admit, our early-morning introduction to the Ellenville festival was pretty sedate. The streets were busy, with vendors scurrying around setting up their booths, but quiet. We stopped at Cohen's Bakery (I mean, how can you not?!) to pick up some prune and blueberry strips and danishes for breakfast and our afternoon hike, and then had our "real" breakfast at the fire hall among all the locals. Again, a familiar country vibe. The firehouse breakfast would have fit in perfectly with the Montrose festival, too.

After breakfast, we joined the few dozen other people who were leisurely browsing the stands along Center Street. But the atmosphere was in transition. After an hour or so, what I can only assume was the New York City crowd arrived. The scene became suddenly louder and about a hundred times more crowded.  Urban beats pounded on every corner. You were conveyed from one vendor to the next by elbows and butt-shoves, whether you wanted to be or not. It was interesting, and tolerable for a short time, but ridiculously disparate from the scene at Montrose. 

We had a good time regardless. We found local honey (spring wildflower for mom and fall wildflower for me), met some of the trail maintenance crew at the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference table, and couldn't get close to the Cohen's Bakery tent—but at least we still had our prune strips for the hike.

The real blueberry festival for us was in the mountains.
