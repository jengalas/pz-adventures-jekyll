We were having trouble all week deciding when to leave on our annual journey to Maine. Our first thought was to try leaving around midnight like we did, successfully, in 2017. We ended up pretty close to that, leaving at 11pm. After a pretty routine morning and afternoon (if you can ignore the three solid days of nonstop rain that resulted in 4.3 inches in the gauge and persistent showers over us all morning and afternoon ... *we* couldn't ignore them), we lay down for some rest around 6:45pm and planned to get up around 10. We kept close to that schedule, getting up around 10:15, having a small snack of frozen pasta and veggies, and leaving the house at 11pm. 

Traffic wasn't too bad, although it was heavier than during our late-night drive in 2017. Almost all trucks for the first several hours, and they were mostly behaving. A few cars joined now and then, and were coming onto the highway in greater numbers (and crazier speeds) by the time we were on the Mass Pike and I-495. We took a quick detour through Vernon, Connecticut, around 2:30am looking for coffee, but nothing was open. We continued on to the Charleton Plaza East, where even the McDonalds was closed at 3:30am. (We were able to get a self-serve coffee from this weird attached convenience store that we both thought looked and felt like something from another universe or at least another galazy. SO bizarre inclding the character that worked there.) Back on the highway and it was busy but smooth sailing until the start of I-95 (Maine turnpike) where 495 ended. Right at the toll area (where we had unintentionally chosen the cash side, but it still had ezpay) We found ourselves suddenyl in a fog bank so thick it was impossible to see anything for a few (rather terrifying) seconds. It was like driving into a white wall. Fortunately it let up just enough that we could see and then follow the trucks coming through the ezpass side of the toll area. While there was some fog for the rest of the night's ravel it wa wispy and did not really affect visibility. Almost exactly consistent with our timng in 2017 (just one hour earlier) we reached the Kittery rest area at 5:30am. I'd had no sleep all day (could not sleep while we were resting in the afternoon and evening) and thought I would get a few hours easily while at the rest area. Our eye masks worked great, blocking the light that would always hit us squarely in the eyes no matter where we parked or how we angled the car. And I was very comfortable temperature-wise and at least somewhat comfortable otherwise, but simply could not sleep. Rich (having had a decent rest) woke me up around 7:15 and we headed back out on the highway around 7:40.
