I had planned on running around Eagle Lake this morning as long as I was feeling rested and up to the challenge, which I could tell I was when we woke up. We wanted to get there early to find a parking space and enjoy the carriage roads before the crowds arrived, so breakfast was a very quick banana and half of a blueberry muffin. Then we headed out.

We were lucky enough to find an end spot in the carriage road parking lot, which was still half empty. Entering the Eagle Lake loop means passing through the echoey stone underpass, which is always fun. As soon as we reached the first intersection, Rich headed east to look for some photo compositions, and I was off to climb the hills on the western shore of the lake.

And hills they were! Although they aren't as steep as they appear on the elevation profile on my watch (I realized that I'm used to looking 5k instead of 10k) they are long and relentless - but still easily doable with a bit of persistence.

It was so pleasant, having what felt like the entire carriage road system around the lake to myself. I only saw a few other people out so early in the morning, including a cyclist who asked me "Does this hill ever end?" to which I was able to consult my watch and tell him that he hadn't much farther to go - little did I know that he was turning onto the Aunt Betty Pond loop, which continues a steep ascent. I saw only three hikers and three other runners for almost the full distance, until I got to the easter side of the lake close to the entrance. Then it was later in the morning and the e-bikers were showing up.

I loved the warmth of the sun just peeking, in spots, through the cool conifers all around me. I heard red squirrels in the trees, and got an occasional shower as the barest of breezes shook the drops from last night's rain onto the carriage road.

Looping around the lake, I ran into Rich at around the 9km mark. I hadn't quite completed the loop and I wanted to make it to 10km anyway, so I said I'd meet him when I was done, and he said he'd start walking back toward our beginning point. I needed to go a bit past the spur to the parking area and back to make the 10km, and so I just kept running until I ran into Rich (for a total of 10.22km). It was my longest run to date, and I'll be feeling it later, but it sure was fun, and this was the first time I felt like completing the half marathon might just be possible with enough training (and avoiding injury!).

I dried off and cleaned up quickly, and we headed down Holland Ave. to West Street, ultimately ending up at the Sunrise Cafe. There was a line hundreds of people long waiting to board the whale watch cruise ship, but fortunately Sunrise was nearly empty, and we only had to wait a minute before we could order. And we sure did order two lobster crepes! :grin:

We decided to sit outside since it was such a pleasant, calm day. Cafe staff brought our crepes out quickly, and we savored every bite. It's still hard to believe how much lobster they stuff inside the crepes - definitely one of the best values, not to mention how great it tastes. And they are so beautifully presented. Lobster crepes on the whale watch dock sounds like a major tourist trap item, but they are the real deal.

On our way back to the room, we stopped in Cadillac Mountain Sports to pick up two more of the caps I've been using for running. Figured I might as well get a few more now that I know I like them and we can easily obtain them there. We also looked for a blank card in Walgreens, hoping to have something on hand when we leave to make sure Christopher gets the tip we leave for the housekeepers, but we couldn't find anything. I later got everything we needed from Constance at the front desk.

We both needed a long, restful afternoon just hanging around on the porch, which was exactly what we did. I wrote up all of our benchmark recoveries from the past few days, and Rich continued to read the book he's into now ("All the Knowledge in the World," by Simon Garfield). Over the course of the afternoon I made myself three cups of super-energy black tea with the addition of a lavender herbal tea. The afternoon was warm and relaxing and peaceful (if you could ignore the leaf blower, truck back-up signals, and fire sirens). 

After yesterday's light supper (and keeping mind that Rosalie's is closed on Mondays anyway) we had been looking forward to going to Brasserie Le Brun this evening. We were still kinda full all throughout the afternoon from our lobster rolls at breakfast, but by 3:45pm when we headed back into town toward Le Brun, we had plenty of appetite, and room in our bellies, to spare.

The place was deserted as usual at 4:00pm, which was great for us. (Not to fear, it always gets busy later, which was even commented on by someone passing by as we waited for the door to open.) We were given our usual favorite table in the front window, and ordered our new favorite drink, Death in the Afternoon, to start.

After a bit of confusion over the absinthe to be used in the drink, we were presented with our lovely cocktails. We told the hostess how much we liked them, and asked why they were no longer on the menu.

"I had them on the menu for two years," she said, "but so many people were unfamiliar with absinthe and ended up sending them back, that it just ended up being too much wasted product." We were unfamiliar with them the first time too, we said, but we gave it a try and loved them! She said she loves it too, but it may not be going back on the menu. They are still happy to make them for us anytime.

According to Hemingway, who created the drink, you're supposed to enjoy three to five us them for the most "benefit." We're a long way off from that, but he had the right idea!

French bread with their amazing shallot-chive butter came out next. Our server Brynna was over the moon excited about the butter, and I can't blame her! It is so good. Rich even wanted to take some home with us.

Our appetizer came out just after the bread. It was a special this evening: scallop ceviche with lime, coconut, cilantro, and a root vegetable that we're not sure of. I'm always a bit hesitant about scallops - they have been only of only about two or three foods that I've historically disliked - but honestly, I've tried them a few times in recent years and found them to be excellent. I knew Rich really wanted to try the ceviche, so I was more than willing to give it a try. And it was excellent! The scallops were sweet and tender, not fishy at all, and the cilantro and creamy sauce went so well together. It was served with cucumber rounds and blue corn chips which made an excellent pairing.

Although we had discussed trying the duck a la orange, we both ended up getting BEAST again: the usual filet for me, and hanger steak for Rich, both prepared au poivre with a potato puree and sherry cream sauce. They were both outstanding, and we shared as we always do. (Although they were very similar, it was interesting to taste the slight difference in the cuts of beef.)

Our conversation centered around our literary educations (possibly this conversation was inspired by the Hemingway reference earlier?) and how much of the value of classic literature is lost on high schoolers, even those with dedicated teachers. You simply need life experience and years of thought and study behind you to truly understand a lot of what makes the classics what they are.

At some point the dessert menu arrived, now switched to fall-inspired offerings rather than the summery fare from last week - a bit of a bummer because I had been hoping to try the blueberry tartlette. But they had an apple tartlette that sounded perfect, and it was. It was a nice crisp butter shell filled with a very lightly spiced apple compote and topped with a vanilla cheesecake cream. We couldn't even identify the flavor of the cream at first; it just tasted like a super-vanilla, if that makes sense. Brynna reminded us that it was cheesecake and that's where the tanginess was coming from, and it all made sense.

We were discussing "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and my ill-fated ninth grade skit from "Romeo and Juliet" ("aye aye, the 75 feet of yellow nylon rope!") as we rounded the corner to check on the menu at the Black Friar. We were somewhat curious to try it this year, even after last year's mishap, but nothing really appeals to us this time. We'll see what happens next year.

The rest of the evening was spent enjoying a few videos and, as always, working on research and notes from the day's adventures!
