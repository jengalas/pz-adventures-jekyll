We expected that today would be a cloudy, chilly day with some rain showers in the afternoon. Because of that we thought it could be a good day for photography, and Rich suggested "something mild" for this morning. Breakfast was bagel (salt & pepper with spicy jalapeno lime cream cheese and croissant breakfast sandwich with ham) from A Slice of Eden again, with just a slight delay because for some reason they had a one hour delay for opening (8:00am instead of 7:00). We were the first ones in the door. While we waited for our food we chatted for a few minutes with a young woman named Libby who was apparently a first-time visitor.

While eating on our porch, we decided on our day's activities: a walk from town to Sieur de Monts via Spring Street, Great Meadow Loop, and the Jesup Path. It was a nice morning with occasional sunshine, warm enough that we left our fleece vests and pullovers in the room. We had all the trails to ourselves until we reached the gravel section of the Jesup Path nearing Sieur de Monts, where a few people began to pass by, and then the boardwalk section was busy as it typically is. We still had a few opportunities for photography along the way, although it's always difficult taking photos on a path as narrow as the boardwalk. 

At Sieur de Monts it became cooler and darker, although this might have been just because we were deeper in the woods. It did feel like rain was very close by, though. We began to walk the Wild Garden Path toward the Tarn, and very soon we came upon what looked at first to be a large culvert lined with large granite blocks in the typical Acadian building style. I turned to look at it from a few feet further down the trail, though, and at the same time as Rich, realized that there was actually a road grade passing over this culvert. It was the remnants of an old, wide road passing over this bridge! 

We were suddenly so excited, realizing that this may have been one of the original entry routes into the park! We later found a road that matches up with this area on the 1921 and 1930 maps. We also found a road that matches up with the other old road I discovered last year, just north of the quarry along Great Meadow path. That seems to head over toward the Kebo steps and is probably the Kebo Mountain, East Side (#374) path mentioned in Pathmakers. They make no mention of the steps, but could they have been part of this trail?

The bus schedules didn't work out for us today (it's so much harder to get to and from Sieur de Monts this year) so we ended up walking back to town.

It had turned chilly while we were at Sieur de Monts, and although the sky brightened and it warmed up considerably while we were walking back to town, by an hour and a half later when we were leaving for supper, it was raining lightly and we felt cold. We had decided on Rosalie's again, always comforting on a chilly day and after a long walk, and good for a lighter, more casual meal. 

We planned to be there by 4:00pm when they opened so we would have our choice of tables, and it worked out well. (Although the place surprisingly wasn't as busy as I expected for a cold, drizzly Sunday evening.) We took the first booth on the 1st floor, which is relatively secluded, although it was chilly at first because the door was propped open. It became much cozier later, when the workers there closed the door, and at that point I felt like I could have stayed and talked about the old roads and trails for another hour! Too bad we were almost done with our pizza and beer. 

We sipped on the remainder of our beer for a while just to enjoy the warmth and continue discussing the old paths. Tonight's pizza was half "peps" and half House Veggie, a combination of tomato, onion, garlic, green pepper, and broccoli that I had been dying to try and that was _very_ good. Rich admitted he was a bit skeptical at first, particularly about the green pepper, but he ended up really enjoying it. We'll get it again.

We were relaxing in our room and I was writing these notes when a couple from Florida arrived late. I heard them rolling their luggage across the porch and went out to explain our parking arrangement (I like to do this to make sure that people understand that we're just trying to make it easier for people and not trying to be jerks and make it harder to get out of the spot.) They seemed to understand, and a few minutes later we noticed that their car was gone. They must have run out for something. 

The man came back soon afterward and parked as we had suggested, which was great. We were settling in when all of a sudden the fire alarm starting blaring! In all our years coming here, this has never happened. We went outside and after a few minutes our new neighbor (quintessential Florida man) came out saying that it was also blaring in their room (which we could hear). He said "well, maybe it didn't like our hot shower." 

We thought that was pretty bizarre but it actually turned out to be the case. Apparently they hadn't turned on the fan and the combination of steam and heat set off the alarm. The fire department arrived within a few minutes to clear the building. 

In the midst of this craziness, I got a text from a random number that just said `Gary?` So we determined that we had fallen though a wormhole, and that somehow Gary was responsible.
