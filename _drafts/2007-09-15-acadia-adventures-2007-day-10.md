Orange pecan roll, jam spot (biscuit), Earl Grey cookie, pecan square, tea (Earl Grey) and coffee at Morning Glory, which we ate in the car (cozy!).  Went to Beech Mountain for ranger program in the rain.  Learned about mosses, lichens and ferns.  Poked around at Seal Cove trying to see how we might get to the tri-station on Robbins Hill.  Didn't find anything very useful.  Tried measuring the distance to the intersection as mentioned on the datasheet.  Went to Beal's again for lobster and tried the crab and corn chowder.  Nap.  Rosalie's for pizza, pepperoni and sausage this time.  Wandered around by the pier looking for marks, went to Acadia Shops, wine shop with other interesting items where we bought 10 Mile Wine.
