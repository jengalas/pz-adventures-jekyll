We were both desperately in need of a rest day today, and I think we mostly got one. 

Our breakfast was very simple: one and a half slices of leftover pizza for me, a small yogurt for Rich, and coffee, Constant Comment tea, and juice as usual. We ate on the porch, noting the mild and cloudy morning, and expecting rain at any time. 

By the time we were taking our customary walk around town, though, the sun came out and suddenly it was very warm. We were both overdressed in a jacket and vest. We made our way along Bridge Street and West Street, somehow finding ourselves at the Sunrise Cafe, where we split our favorite veggie lover's crepe while avoiding, mostly successfully, the hordes of whale-watching tourists hovering all around us. 

While reading the local events newspaper, Rich noticed that in addition to the MDI half-marathon coming up next Saturday, there is also a 5K event being held on the same day. We checked out the route online, and I decided that I would sign up for it. Might as well give it a go! But I would need some running attire, since what I had brought with me wouldn't really suffice. We first checked the Acadia Outdoors store just because it happened to be on our route, but other than a t-shirt for Lucy, I didn't find anything here that would really work for the race. Cadillac Mountain Sports would be the best store to check, and they had plenty of options. I tried on four different shirts and a pair of shorts, and ended up purchasing the shorts and two of the shirts.

Checking out Dinner's companion restaurant, Lunch (come on, what were you expecting?) was the final stop on our morning walk. It's a sandwich shop that could be a good option for ... lunch.  Although we don't typically eat lunch while we're here, as you can see already by today's activities, once in a while we do (even if we consider it second breakfast). Today's special was a tuna melt with tomato and dill Havarti, which sounds like something Rich would really love, and I would enjoy it too.

The afternoon was spent drinking more coffee and tea on the porch, working on notes and adding a few features to my "benchmark search by radius" application. 

Dinner was an option for tonight's evening meal, but I saw online that they are now taking reservations. That probably means that they're more popular than before, and that we may not be able to walk in at 5:00pm as we used to. I tried calling them a few times during the afternoon but wasn't able to get an answer, so we decided it would be best not to risk waiting and then finding out that they were booked. Instead we planned to make a Sunday reservation for Dinner. Then we went to Brasserie Le Brun, where we were pretty sure we would have our choice of tables if we arrived right at 4:00pm, which we did.

We got our usual small table in the front of the restaurant. A couple with a tiny baby arrived shortly after us, and we were afraid of what the kid would sound like, but he honestly was very quiet. Not so quiet was the group of people that arrived next, but at least they were seated all the way across the restaurant from us.

Our server was a little confused when we asked for the cocktail we had enjoyed so much last year - Death in the Afternoon, made with absinthe, but he asked the bartender and they were indeed able to make it, even though it is no longer on their list of featured drinks. (I assume they change that list frequently.) They were beautiful and as delicious as we remembered them! I can hardly wait to go back and have another one.

Along with the drinks, we thoroughly enjoyed the warm French bread with caramelized onions baked into the dough, and accompanied by chive butter. There is really no better appetizer! Although the crab cake we got next was pretty damned amazing. As you would expect here, it was all crab meat (no fillers) fried perfectly crispy and served with a mustard-seed sauce and topped with an apple-kale salad. (Yes, Rich ate the kale and enjoyed it!)

Our main courses were beef, which is unusual for us, but it's perfectly done here. I had the filet au poivre, served tonight with a sherry cream sauce and potato puree. Rich had the short rib Bourguignon, which we had last year as well, and it was amazingly good both times. I can't say enough about how wonderful the food is here. The atmosphere is nice too; it doesn't get insanely loud even when it's full.

All of the food is so good, and filling/satisfying but not overly rich; just perfect. We even had room for dessert, one that we had picked out beforehand, a coconut mango mousse cake! It was as good as it sounds. It even came with what Rich called "coconut toenails" on top (large coconut flakes that did indeed resemble toenails). Rich mentioned this jokingly to the server, who caught on immediately and said "Did you say toenails? Yeah, I see what you mean ..._you_ can use that verbiage, but I'm not going to!" But it occurred to me that for the rest of the evening, every time he brings out one of those desserts, he's going to be thinking about toenails.

After finishing up, we took a slow walk back to the room - it's chilly now - stopping only to check out the menu at the new hotel in town (Pathmaker). It is a small menu that looks moderately interesting. We may try it sometime.

I tried a few times but I wasn't able to reach Dinner on the phone, so I ran down to the restaurant to make a reservation in person. We're set for Sunday evening at 5:15. Unfortunately we couldn't get either of the two window tables; both were already reserved until 7:30pm. So we took the only remaining table, which is right in the center. Hopefully it will work out OK.

It was another relatively early evening with plenty of relaxing (in our nice heated room!) and note taking and researching.

"All good," as Rich said!
