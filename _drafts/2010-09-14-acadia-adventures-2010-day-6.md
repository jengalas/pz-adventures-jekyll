Thunderstorm in morning, while eating and then afterward for about half an hour. Once it started to clear, we went down to the bar and walked over to Bar Island (although we didn't hike on the island itself).  Sun was starting to break through and it was getting warmer.  Then took a slow drive along Park Loop Road to an unmarked path just past the Precipice parking area.  We hiked in a short distance toward the climbing areas.  I would have gone higher if it weren't so wet and slippery.  Next, we stopped at Sand Beach where we both went into the (cold) water!  It really didn't feel all that bad. Then to Jordan Pond House, where we had our popovers.  Sun was out here too and it felt very nice and warm, even though they weren't serving outdoors so everyone had to eat inside.  While we were waiting to be seated, we checked out the gift shop.  I was hoping to find a hiker charm for my bracelet to symbolize Rich being able to hike again, but they didn't have anything.  Instead, we got a starfish in remembrance of the starfish we saw at Anemonemonemone Cave.  Then we hiked down the nature trail, through the woods and up to the carriage road near the Jordan Cliffs trail.  Walked over to look at the Spring Trail and back to Jordan Cliffs, where I took a short 10-minute or so hike up just to see what it was like.  It looked like an awesome trail, but I didn't even get as far as the cliffs or any of the ladders.  Next time we will do it together!  After returning to Rich who was waiting at the trailhead, we walked back down the carriage road toward Jordan Pond.  We wandered over toward the "she dearly loved this spot" bench where we stood and looked at the pond and Bubbles for a while.  Then we took two chairs from one of the tables, since they weren't in use, and sat on the lawn warming up in the sun.  We walked down to Maggie's for supper, running into Brandon and dog on the way.  After supper we wandered around town for a while, dodging tourists and checking out a few of the junk shops along the way.  Then wine and snuggles!!!!
