Breakfast at Two Cats: granola and milk, tea; summer scramble with eggs, tomatoes, etc., bacon, biscuit with the standard strawberry butter, coffee (R).  Our morning hike began at Sieur de Monts and, once we found the correct path thanks to someone at the old Abbe Museum, the Tarn Trail (which should be referred to by its old name, the Kane Path).  From that trail, we took the Ladder Trail, which is an awesomely built and restored stair-step trail with three ladders/sets of iron rungs (false legs!).  It's slightly strenuous steadily upward hike but with no exposures so the ladders and stretches are easily accomplished without intimidation.  There's only one spot at the top of the first ladder (right after the lemon squeeze!) that is rather vertigo-inducing, for some reason; I think it's just an illusion as there's really no exposure here either.  We then took the Schiff Path, which is mostly level, to Kurt Diederich's climb, which is another old stepped trail.  This took us back to the northern end of the Tarn.  From here we walked out to the road to see if there were any paths from the Route 3 parking area (there aren't), then back toward Sieur de Monts on the "proper" path.  Spent much of the afternoon watching Dave and Jenny climb at Otter Cliff.

Supper at Fathom!  Blueberry Ale and Lobster Red Ale (no, not made with lobster). Wild boar chili and lobster/red snapper spring roll to start. Roast duck with blackberry sauce, broccolini and mashed sweet potatoes; grilled venison and wild duck sausage, red potatoes. My father called while we were eating to say he was on his way and leaving Rein's Deli at the time.

Spent the rest of the evening relaxing in the room and reading the _Trails of History_ book, and learning more about the trails we hiked this morning.
