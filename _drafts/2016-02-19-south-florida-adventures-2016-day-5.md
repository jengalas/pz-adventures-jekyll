Our day began at the "fake beach" near the tiki bar. We watched the sun come up over the bay  while we had coffee, earl grey tea, a sticky bun and a key lime bundt cake of which piggy moose ate the whole thing  <snort>. So relaxing! We met a couple from Oregon who come here twice a year and are currently building a house nearby on sugarloaf key. They plan to move here within a few months.

Our plan was to head immediately to Key West, specifically Old Town Bakery.  There were no obvious parking spots near the bakery so we just went right to the parking garage a block away, which was also more full than we expected. We found a spot on the 3rd floor and paid the full day rate of $13.

We were heading to the bakery when we noticed that Bien, one of our favorite Latin/Caribbean restaurants formerly known as Paseo, seemed to be open for breakfast. They had a nice little breakfast menu and what really caught our attention was the Cuban toast with add-ons. Rich said come on, let's get one! We ended up getting one with scrambled egg and salsa Verde. It was fantastic! We had coffee with it and Natalie's orange juice, which tastes fresh squeezed. We had planned to stop there for one of their grilled spiced ears of corn but they had a notice on the menu that the recent corn shipments didn't meet their standards so they won't be offering the corn until they can find better. A chicken family with half a dozen tiny fuzzy yellow chicks were wandering around, just like last time. We were impressed by their renovation which was done in August 2014 according to the girl working at the counter.

Next we crossed the road to the bakery. We were already kinda stuffed but decided to get a few pastries for the morning. We chose a peach cobbler Danish and almond croissant and then took them back to the car. We were ready to head further into town.

We walked down Eaton St. looking at all the palm trees, cacti, poinsettias, etc. in front of the homes. Went to the square via Duval St. We checked to make sure Pepes was still there.then we checked out the statue garden with all the busts of mostly local historical figures. (What is Lenin doing there? Oh.) We also enjoyed looking at the memorial bricks.
Then we walked through the Westin plaza and took a casual look for two benchmarks near the bollards on either corner of the pier.

Hungry again somehow, we stopped at Garbos grill now at Grunts Bar. Started with Korean style shrimp tacos and then had to get another order cayo style. Both were amazing although we both preferred the cayo with mango, jalapenos, cabbage, cilantro, and grilled shrimps. We had a lemon lime unsweetened iced tea also.

From there we went to the Truman Little White house where we took a tour around 12:45. Very interesting and something wet knew nothing about. Truman had visited key west 11 times and the house is restored to the state of its 1948 restoration. Interesting stories about his family and a nice video with old footage. Several images show a radio tower that might be the one referred to in  bm description.

Walked back to the car to get my jacket because it was feeling like or would get chilly at night and drop off a few things. We walked back along Southard St. and found a bm in the sidewalk along the way.

After retrieving our things at the car we took a slow walk the long way around to Westin plaza again, stopping along the way to buy two silver charms at a jewelry shop. We then sat at a bench and rested for about 45 minutes while watching the shuttle boats to Sunset Island. Then we had a wonderful supper at Pepes! Mojitos of course and fried pork chunks with onions and cilantro and the red and green sauces from the bread, then mahi in Creole shrimp sauce with yellow rice and black beans and extra plantains!!! Watched the sunset, although cloud obscured it, from the square before heading back.stopped at Publix on the way for juice and wine.
