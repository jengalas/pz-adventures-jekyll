Dad left early this morning, after a tasty breakfast served at 2 cats. (Where are the island guys? We were served by a brash young woman who must have been from New Jersey, no Jamaicans to be found.) Food was good, pancakes for R and granola with fruit for me and dad (although I had mine with milk and he had yogurt). After a stop at Mount Dessert Bakery for al ittle treat for the drive - another slice of orange cake - He left a little after 9:00am to head to Olympia Lodge in Manchester Center, Vermont.

Although it was already windy, it was nice and cloudy, conditions we had been waiting for to do some photography. We returned to the Witch Hole area, this time parking alnog the Loop Road and coming in along the trail that Libby had mentioned (we noted at hte time that part of it had obviously been a road at one point, and checked the maps when we came back to find that was true, although we don't know the name of the road or any other details. [check Pathmakers #344]) We had a wonderful time along the marshes and ponds! Looking closely we could see pitcher plant flowers poking up all over the place but although I tried many times, I couldn't get close enough to any of them for anything other than habitat, from-a-distance photos. The wind was crazy and photography was a major challenge, but so much fun! We found a turtle nest with hatched eggs, and Indian pipe all over the place. Toward the end, after we enjoyed our snack of blueberry cream cheese danish, I went a little further and found one of hte areas of sundews I had found on Tuesday but hadn't photographed. By now we were really cold and since it was already after 2pm it was time to head back up the carriage roads and trail, and back to the car.

We had one more little adventure in mind and we attempted to complete it, but conditions were just too unpleasant this afternoon. We wanted to look for those drill holes and astro stone on Cadillac. As we climbed the mountain the temperature kept dropping and the wind kept getting crazier. There were wind-blown drops and a few heavier showers. Fortunately it wasn't raining by the time we reached the top. R stayed with the car and I ran up to the start of the South Ridge trail to look for drill holes. I immediately found one, but it was 50 or so feet from my coordinates so I have no idea if might have been one of the ones I was looking for, or something else. There was just no real opportunity to look around with such nasty conditions. Another set of coordinates took me to the reference mark that is also USGS disk K 24. Could they have used the drill hole to place that disk years later? And the third set of coordinates was leading me into the woods which was just way too unpleasant to consider today. We'll come back on a nicer day when we can both have a look around, even if it's not this year.

Dinner at rogue was awesome. We started with beers (ale and IPA) and their biscuits and bread. Then we each had a salad - local melon salad for me with cantaloupe, yellow watermelon-like fruit (not sure what it was), burrata, and local greens tossed with nuts and balsamic, and warm lobster salad with greens, sweet corn and locally foraged chicken of the woods mushroom - this was awesomely seasoned! Entrees were pork scallopini with the mushrooms with crispy potato cake, beets and yellow squash for R, miso and maple glazed salmon with fingerling potatoes, miso slaw, yellow squash and beets. Dessert was my usual lavender creme brulee and R tried the panna cotta with local peach and vanilla sauce. Fantastic! We drove back through the ending rain listening to Yanni.
