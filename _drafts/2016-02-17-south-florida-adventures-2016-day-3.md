Day began with fruit (melon and pineapple this time) and a whole wheat bagel with cream cheese. We intended to head straight to the Ernest Coe visitor center but were distracted by a huge pile of glass in the road, missed our turn and ended up on the road to the Keys instead! There is no place to legally turn around for at least 18 miles but we found an opening and made an illegal u-turn, really had no other choice.

Once righted we quickly came upon Robert is Here,  the famous fruit stand. It was too early for one of their famous milkshakes but we bought some bananas for a trail snack. I tasted several different honeys (really liked the tropical wildflower!) and R was greatly enamored of the fresh juicy spring onions!  He was thinking about them all day, or at least until late afternoon when he began dreaming about pizza. :)

On our way to the park entrance we passed by the Gator Grill. It wasn't open for the day yet but we could see that it was still in business, so we began considering it as a snack for later.
We went into the visitor center to ask about the Nike missile site but the ranger there mentioned 3 boat tours from Flamingo that really piqued R's interest. So we're headed down to Flamingo to find out about them. Tickets are purchased at the marina store, we found out; not at the visitor center. After buying our tickets we had an hour and a half to explore so we  searched for some of the tidal BMS we hadn't looked for last time. We found many of them all while being eaten alive by mosquitos. We soon went back into the marina store to buy more bug spray!

While we were wandering around the marina we saw a crocodile swimming in the channel. He came quite close to one dock where we had found a BM already and we decided to go back over there to see if we could get a photo of the BM with him in the background. As we approached we couldn'tsee him anywhere. I Leaned over the dock and he was RIGHT THERE! We must have startled him because he made a weird sound, smacked the water with his tail, and dove deep. He was gone. About 5 minutes later he resurfaced nearer to the mangroves at the other edge of the channel, where we had initially seen him.

We had time to look for another bm near the visitor center. On our way there we watched an osprey and a pileated woodpecker who was digging deep into a dead tree, tossing out chunks of wood as he pecked and drilled.   We found it at the very edge of the seawall behind a tree and clouded in mosquitoes. I hurriedly took my photos while r stayed out of the line of fire and talked to some guys fishing from a picnic table.

Now it was time for our boat tour. Fortunately we ended up on a boat with NO kids and only about 8 adults. Before we even started we saw a large manatee in the marina. Apparently he is one of a family of 9. He wasn't moving around much, though, and we couldn't get close to him.  Very pleasant cruise into the bay where we saw little blue heron and night heron in a tree, ibises (ibi?), ospreys, and bottlenose  dolphins! Which are apparently quite rare to see here. We chased those dolphins for much of the trip and loved their antics. Once we got very close, one of them leaped in front of the boat and then actually starting surfing the wake alongside us for a minute! I also saw two turtles for sure, a large one and a tiny one, and possibly a third medium sized one.

As the boat pulled back toward the dock the first mate /deck hand Tom started yelling at people on the dock to move. Apparently they were watching a manatee! After the boat docked we took some time to photograph him and then headed out.

Our next stop was the Nike missile site near Royal Palm. We had actually planned on doing that tour today but the boat ride pulled us in another direction. We went to the meeting spot knowing we were too late for the tour  but wanting to see if anyone was there. The place looked deserted but a woman in the parking lot explained that the building was only offices and that wet could continue on down the road and could enter the site as long add the gate was open. Which we did.  Very cool abs wet had to laugh at the juxtaposition of the "visitors welcome" and "we are authorized to shoot you on sight" signs.  It looks like it could be a great tour so it's on the list for next time.
We then spent some time at Royal Palm walking the Anhinga Trail and spotting 3 alligators and beautiful bromeliads.

Time for supper at the gator grill! Fantastic as before. We split the gator basket which comes with grilled gator bites, fried ripe plantain, cole slaw and sea salt french fries, and grouper tacos which come with amazingly fresh and delicious salsa and homemade tortilla chips. Rich obtained a menu from inside after we ate and made note of the hours. Our plan was to have key lime pie with our bottle of wine back at the hotel for dessert, which we did and it was wonderful. The hotels pie is creamy and has a thin crust with a very thin layer of dark chocolate on top of the crust. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the chocolate but I loved it!
