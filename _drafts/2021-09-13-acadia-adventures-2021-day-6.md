We awoke to our 10th M00severasary! The years have flown by and nothing could have been better. This morning there was an unexpected light drizzle in the air, but it passed quickly and was gone before 8am, by the time we were heading down to Mount Dessert Bakery for our breakfast bagels and whatever other assorted goodies we might find there. And we weren't the only ones with that idea -- the bakery was mobbed! The line was out the door and it took 10-15 minutes just to get inside, but once we did everything moved quickly, so I'm not sure what the problem was initially. They didn't have sticky buns on the menu today, but there wre plenty of different goodies to choose from. We were both in the mood for bagels, so we ordered two plain bagels, toasted, with cream cheese on the side (veggie for R and lox (with capers, red onion, capers, and dill)) for me. We also got tea, coffee, and juice, plus two danishes (strawberry-rhubarb and blueberry-cheese) for later. Just like we did on Friday, we brought our treats back to the porch to enjoy them.

By now it was getting warm, and we planned on hiking to Great Head in celebration of our m00seversary (returning to the scene of the crime, as we said!). We planned to hike Great Head from the back way along Schooner Head Road rather than from Sand Beach, which is the more popular route. I was really concerned with the amount of people here this year that the small parking lot north of Great Head wuld be full, and even more cncerned once I saw the mile-long line of cars on either side of the Precipice trail parking lot. But not to worry, we were lucky that there were only a few cars in the lot and we were even able to get an end spot.

After a pit stop in the woods (I had a lot of tea for breakfast) we set out on the trail. It was muddy in spots as Rich expected (he said it's always muddy along this part of the trail). we hiked through pine forest carpeted with bunchberry (mostly not in fruit), Indian cucumber, and moss. We spotted a few nice mushrooms along the way, including a particularly perfect one just off a small section of bogwalk. The trail was mostly level and wooded, somewhat rooted and rocky but easy walking until the last few hundred feet, which involved some easy rock scrambling up to the Head.

People were coming and going, mostly not staying at the summit, which was perfect for us. They left us alone as we checked on the triangulation station and took some 10-year photos. I also gave Rich the GREAT HEAD replica benchmark that I had 3D printed as a little memento. He loved it and took a photo with the replica next to the actual mark. We sat and talked for along time, feeling the sun starting to burn along with the wind. We watched some birds that we couldn't identify that had some yellow on their bodies, and a red squirrel run by us.

We hiked back the way we had come, returning to the car a bit hungry and looking forward to those danishes I had brought with us. Note: while we were driving along Schooner Head Road just north of the Great Head parking area, I spotted what looked like an old road, blocked off with boulders, leading uphill to the east. Checking the map later, it appears this may have been an old road that led up to Oak Hill Cliff. I really want to check this out!

We planned to drive through the park and find a nice spot to sit and eat them n the rocks, but the sheer amount of cars and people in the park was like nothing we've ever seen before. Miles and miles of cars parked in the right lane! People everywhere! We decided just to take our snacks back to our balcony, where we enjoyed them along with two beers. :) 

While we were eating my father arrived. We chatted for a few minutes about his drive here and meeting with the Pagodas in New Hamshire, and then he checked in and set up in his room while I called the Black Friar to make dinner reservations for 4:30. That went very well! We had the nice table for 3 in the back, no one else in the room (although two couples came in, sat down at another table, grumbled a bit and then left - when the third couple came in we wondered if they too would leave, at which point we would be convinced that table was haunted, but they styaed and seemed to be having a good time. The food was really excellent, as usual. Rich and I both had an IPA with pineapple/mango notes and dad had the Oktoberfest. Then Rich and I shared the Weldh rarebit (Dad even had a piece and didn't mind it, though he famously doens't care for Welsh rarebit). Dad had wanted fish & chips at the brewery he isited last night but they were out of it, so he got it here and it was enormous and excellent! Rich and I both had tacos, pulled pork for him and fish for me. The pulled pork came with corn salsa, very fresh and tasty, just a bit of spice. The fish tacos (which I've had before, but these were slightly different) had a sweet vinegary slaw and spicy dressing. The fish was haddock. We were realy bad and shared a slice of blueberry pie for dessert, too.

Walked back to the room while Dad went to check out the menu at Mount Dessert Bakery. Spent the night looknig at maps and watching a few videos!
