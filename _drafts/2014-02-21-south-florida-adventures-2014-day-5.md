A casual exploration of the wonders of Key West was our plan for today. For me and Rich, one of our favorite ways to learn about a new area is to search for some benchmarks there. So it's not surprising that we had a few in mind for today.

But first ... breakfast! We love small local bakeries that feature a variety of artisan breads and buttery pastries, and Old Town Bakery on Eaton Street sounded just right. It was, in fact, <em>amazing</em>! We shared an egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich and a raspberry-cheese danish, and also picked up two croissants (plain and raspberry-filled) for later. While we nibbled—sitting across the street at the outdoor tables for the restaurant Paseo, which doesn't open until lunchtime—a family of chickens ate with us. <!-- We found out later that the city assesses an $800 "impact fee" per chair, so this is probably what the bakery owner meant by it being difficult to offer seating. -->

Parking in Key West is notoriously difficult, but I guess we were lucky (or just early enough)—Rich grabbed a spot on Thomas Street, centrally located to where we planned to spend the day. Much of our plan for the day's activities was built around various benchmark locations. Our first target was a benchmark disk set vertically into the brick wall of the old courthouse. It was an easy find, once we located the correct building, and required a quick dive into the shrubbery to recover it. The disk was encircled with red paint. 

The courthouse cupola is also a station—a landmark station, the easiest type to find (assuming the historical structure is still in existence, which in this case it is). That was another easy find. 

But we weren't done at the courthouse yet! Right in front of the courthouse, on a concrete monument projecting over two feet above the level of the surrounding lawn, is set a standard bench mark disk. Inscribed on the northeast face of the monument are the words **UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY BASIC BENCH MARK**. Very near this mark, also on the courthouse lawn, is the famous "End of the Rainbow" sign and a stately old kapok tree with its intricately undulating root structure.

Next on our benchmark-based tour of Key West was the Southernmost Point monument. It is not a benchmark in itself (just a rather goofy tourist attraction), but a benchmark disk was set into its concrete base, and we hoped to find it. Along the way we happened to find three other marks: one on the fence surrounding the Key West lighthouse, the lighthouse itself (another landmark station), and another "bonus" mark we hadn't been aware of: a FLDOT mark set in the sidewalk on a nearby corner. 

When we reached the Southernmost Point monument, we had a moment of disappointment. The monument was being repainted and was cordoned off. We were still able to stand in front of it (sort of) for the typical tourist photo, but there was no way to get close enough to the monument to search for the disk. We looked, but couldn't spot it—maybe it had been painted over? We would have to come back another day, hopefully when the repainting is done, and search again.

The Hemingway House tour was next on our list. We both loved the tour and the house even more than we expected to. Our tour guide Stan was full of interesting anecdotes—and he even resembled Hemingway in his later years, we both thought, which added an amusing touch to the whole experience. We learned about Hemingway's wives, his time in Cuba, the additions made to the house in the form of swimming pool and writing studio, and of course the famous six-toed cats, which still roam around the property. In the gift shop, we purchased a cat-themed print for my mother.

We wanted to check on the car just to make sure everything was still intact, so we swung by our parking spot and retrieved our nicely-warmed croissants. They made a perfect snack as we walked toward the Audubon House, which we had also planned to tour. Along the way we witnessed a cockfight among the wild roosters! That was crazy. Unfortunately, we discovered that the Audubon House really never was Audubon's house, nor did he stay there when he visited Key West. Our enthusiasm dampened for the moment, we decided to skip it and go for lunch instead.

But where to go? I remembered having read about Garbo's Grill food stand, and we happened to be nearby. In fact we were there right when they opened at 11:30am, so the wait was pretty short. The food was absolutely awesome! We shared shrimp tacos and Korean barbecue burrito. I keep saying this on this trip, but it was some of the best, freshest food we've ever had. The tiny stand is set up in a parking lot, and amenities are scarce—we ended up sitting on top of the cooler where they store some of the ingredients. Often that makes for the best experience!

Now full and satisfied, we set out to recover a few more benchmarks to the north, including the one we found after dinner yesterday when it was too dark to photograph it. We found the benchmark on the old bank as well as the one on the Custom House (which is now the Key West Museum of Art and Culture). Just like at the courthouse, this one required diving into the bushes (autograph trees!) in order to find and photograph it.

With plenty of the day left before us, we wandered to the pier, where we sat and rested for a while, boggling at the enormous cruise ship docked there, and avoiding as much as possible the hordes that emanated from it. Then we decided to do the ultimate touristy thing—ride the Conch Train! This is a typical beach/boardwalk style tram that tours around the city, stopping at various points of interest, and offers guided narration along the way. You are free to get off and back on at any point on the route. Although it was slightly corny, as expected, it did offer an entertaining and useful tour of the town's most famous spots and historic buildings. We even spotted a few more benchmarks along the way!

At the train's first stop, we hopped off and ran across the street to recover TIDAL 24 on the Fairvilla building (could this be the country's only benchmark directly adjacent to a "sexy lingerie" sign?!). Along the way, we also spotted a benchmark near Bayview Park, one near the Catholic church, and another one that we think was somewhere near Higgs Beach—but we're not sure.

We stayed at the second stop to investigate the Little Flagler Museum. It looked fascinating and was filled with artifacts that we'd love to check out, but unfortunately it closed at 3:30pm, and it was just 3:30pm. We finished the tour by taking the next Conch Train back to our boarding location.

Wandering around the little shops made us hungry again, so we headed over to Kelly's, which we had spotted earlier in the day. Fondue was on the posted menu—we had to try it! Apparently it was served only upstairs at "Muse" on the upper balcony. We're not sure if Muse is a separate establishment, but it seems to be affiliated with Kelly's in some way, and it doesn't open until 5:00pm. Kelly's bar looked like a relaxed and fun (but not crazy) environment, so we enjoyed a beer while we waited.

We shared cheddar and classic fondues as well as a Lazy Magnolia Pecan Ale. Wow! The food was rich and delicious and just enough, and the atmosphere, on the rooftop surrounded by candlelight and orchids, was relaxing and beautiful. Imagine eating outside on a rooftop in February! No, it's completely normal in Key West!

Fortunately we had just a tiny bit of room left in our bellies. The walk back to our car took us down Petronia Street, where a family was setting up a pop-up soul food stand. They insisted that we sample some of their goodies, including delicious conch fritters, and we were only too happy to oblige! We also managed to pick up a few slices of Key Lime Pie from Kermit's to have for breakfast.
