Morning was damp and chilly so we ate a little late, then went to sit outside Celtic Rainbow Gifts waiting for it to open.  Didn't open at 10:00 so I checked the sign on the door and saw that it didn't open until 11:00.  So we went back to the room to rest and work on some photos.  Saw Celtic Rainbow's website and found out that they have whiskey and soda bread on Sept 17 :) but will be going out of business when their block is leveled later this year :(.  Went out again around noon and went right to Celtic Rainbow.  Tour buses and cruise people ALL OVER THE PLACE, parked in front of "Testes Restaurant" and walked to Celtic Rainbow.  Asked for Sean to find out he was the owner's son and is now back in school.  She is now working on Fandango.  We talked for a long time about the puzzle, and found out that the block is being cleared to make room for a Marriott hotel.  This is disappointing to say the least.  Had some whiskey and bought some "Maher" pins.

Then upgraded our pass to a yearly park pass (with a m00se on it!) and did a little hike on the Hunters Brook Trail to Hunter's Beach, where we played for a while and enjoyed the sunshine (except when we were trying to take photos). 

Wanted to try to find the cache again but decided not to poke around because of all the PI. Next we went to Little Long Pond to take the short hike down to the carriage road (I did this last year in the rain but Rich didn't trust his knees on the steps, understandably). It was very nice, except too many people with dogs!  And what about all the horse droppings?! 

We went back to the room around 4:00pm and rested, working on some photos and playing until we heard from Alphonse not long after 6:00pm. We decided to meet at Jack Russell's for 7:30. Around 7:00, Rich and I decided to take a ride up to the campground so that Alphonse could follow us and not get lost.  It took longer than we expected to get there.  We found out where his campsite was, but he was gone.  We flew out of there figuring he was already at the restaurant waiting for us.  We got there around 7:35 but he was nowhere to be found.  As soon as we got inside, he called and tried to explain where he was -- apparently somewhere just up the road.  R and I sat down and he joined us just a few minutes later.

It was a great day with lots of little fun tasty aspects unfolding, just like a nice little pastry!  (says Rich)! :)
