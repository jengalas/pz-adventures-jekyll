We decided last night that this mornig's breakfast would be at the Sunrise cafe by the waterfront. Although we arrived a little later than usual, the cafe wasn't busy and we walked right in and up to the counter to order. We must have arrived just in time, though, because a line began to form immediately rigt behind us (I'm pretty sure they were gathering for a whale watch that was leaving soon). We had our favorites, what we've been waiting all year for: blueberry crepe for me, and veggie lovers for R! (And cofffee and Earl Grey as usual.) Everything was excellent, although R noted that he would have liked a litle more olive oil on the veggies tis time. A couple at the table next to us did what we often do, splitting their choices in half and trading halfway thrugh. I thought it was pretty neat; although it may be cmmon, it's not something I often see but we realy like to do it because it gives us a good chance to try different things.

While we ate, I watched the young woman from "SeaSide Images" waitnig for and then taking the tourist photos of people who were about to board the whale watch boat. (The ones where they have the images printed up for people to view and hoepfully buy after their tour.) Pretty amusing, aohuthg I was really hoping to see the guy in the lobster suit like we've seen before. This time the photographer was just posing them behind a life buoy.

We spent the rest of the early morning wandering around town, exploring the Fine Arts Show near Agamont Park and then checking out a few small shops along the way back to our room. 

Our plan for exploring today was to take the bus to Wildwood Stables (via the Visitors center - the only way to get htere on the bus from the Village Green) and then to look for the lower section of the Van Santvoord Trail, and then continue west toward Jordan Pond, where we woudl get a bus back to the viistors center (and then anther to the Green). This worked out well, other than the extremely loud and annoying couple from Wisconsin who kept going on and on about ... Wisconsin to everyone, and not even noticing where they were or the beauty of it. They not only took the bus to the visitors center but hten also got on the bus we were taking to the Stables (and eventualy got off at the stables, altough fortnately they were looking to book a carriage ride and weren't there to hike). 

Along the way we noted extremley long lines of cars for the PRecipe Trail and climbers' trails, and especially Sand BEach. There was a water rescue underway at Thunder Hole (fortunately, we discovered later from people on a later bus who saw the events unfold, the man in trouble was rescued). 

Once at hte stables, we were finally able to soothe our ringing ears by getting away from the annoying couple, who by then were trying to figure out how they could get a carriage ride ("Do we have to bring our own horse or what?!" the goofy guy exclaimed).

We began the steep climb on a cariage road spur up to the carriage road itself, where we then made a shapr left turn and headed toward the coordiantes I had marked for a set of stone steps that formed the top of the lower section of Van Santvoord. Before heading down, though, I wanted to check out the upper section just a bit to see how it might have changed since we were last here. There have indeed been some changes. I only saw two cairns where before it was quite well marked on the lower section. Once you get to the steps it's easy to folllow, but finding the steps from the beginning was a challenge.

I descended again to the carriage road and then headed down the steps, which are a little tricky at first, but once i got down below them it was realtively easy to walk around. There's a stream that winds through this area, and I ended up crossing it a few times in my attempts to find any sign of a trail, more steps or stonework, cairns, etc. Notice that I said attempts. Sad to say but I dind't find much of anything other than that first set of steps. I saw one rock placed on another in an open, centrail location and I woudl bet that was a cairn, but no matter where I looked I could not spot another one, nor did I see any signs of graded land or anyone having walked there. I did spot a boundary marker while I was walking around. On my way back to the carriage road, after determinngi that I needed more information and would have to come back, I made my way to the boundary marker and took some photographs and awaypoint. Then I crossed the stream again and took a few more steps upward ... and I have no idea what made me look down at that point, but I saw a brown pattern that looked at first like some kind of cord. But of course, it was a snake! Right at my feet, so amazing that he was just there at my feet in the midle of the woods like that. I took a few quick photos with my phone because I fully expected him to skitter right off. He dind't. I got my camera out and took a few photos with that. Then I moved a branch off of him so I could get a better view. He still didn't move. At this point I was alittle woried that he was dead, even though he looeked perfecly plump and alive. I gently stroked his back and it took a few seconds, but he evntually shook hinself into motion, raised his head, and flicked his tongue a few times. Then he sat still again, and posed for more phots. What a sweet, gentle snake! It was a beautiful, small maritime garter snake, and such a beautiful encounter.

I hoisted myself back up to the carriage road and found rich, who had been wandering a bit in search fo photographic subjects. I reported on my findings or not-findings, and then we continued west toward Jordan Pond. It has been a dry year here and we dind't see much other than a few fungi and Monotropa hypophytis. We got to Jordan Pond House right as the bus to the visitors center was arriving, so we dind't have time to poke around, but that was Ok.

Supper tonight was the simple pizza we'd been looking forward to all day. We got half pepperoni, half onion, and sat in a booth upstairs. We also got two large Alagash Whites again ("These peps are making me thirsty!") With no room for dessert, we just wandered around the waterfront a bit and Rich practiced his street photography. As we were passing one of the hotels on west Street, what passed by but a Dodge van with Wisconsin plates. Could it be? YES, it was them again!!!
