Last night, we made the decision that we were in the mood for crepes, and so this morning's breakfast would be at the Sunrise Cafe on the waterfront. Although we arrived a little later than usual, the cafe wasn't busy, and we walked right up to the counter to order. 

We must have arrived just in time, though, because a line began to form immediately behind us. I'm pretty sure they were gathering for a whale watch cruise that was leaving soon. We had our favorites, what we've been waiting all year for: wild blueberry crepe for me, and veggie lovers for Rich! (And coffee and Earl Grey as usual.) 

Everything was excellent, although Rich noted that his crepe was a little light on the olive oil. A couple at the table next to us did what we often do, splitting their choices in half and trading halfway through. I thought it was pretty neat; although it may be common, it's not something I often see others do. We really enjoy the opportunity to try different things.

While we ate, I watched the young woman from "SeaSide Images" waiting for and then taking the tourist photos of people who were about to board the whale watch boat. (The ones where they have the images printed up for people to view and hopefully buy after their tour.) Pretty amusing, although I was really hoping to see the guy in the lobster suit like we've seen before. This time the photographer was just posing them behind a life buoy.

We spent the rest of the early morning wandering around town, exploring the Fine Arts Show near Agamont Park and then checking out a few small shops along the way back to our room. 

Our plan for exploring today was to take the bus to Wildwood Stables via the visitors center, which is unfortunately the only way to reach the stables on the bus from the Village Green. The first goal was to search for the lower section of the Van Santvoord Trail, and then we intended to continue west toward Jordan Pond, where we would eventually take a bus back to the visitors center (and then yet another back to the Green). 

This worked out well, aside from the extremely loud and annoying couple from Wisconsin who kept going on and on about ... _Wisconsin_ to everyone within earshot—which was pretty much the entire bus. Imagine it being your first time in such a beautiful place, and spending the entire time carrying on about your hometown. They not only took the bus to the visitors center but also took the connection to the Stables, where they eventually got off (although fortunately they were looking to book a carriage ride, and weren't there to hike). 

Along the way we noted extremely long lines of cars for the Precipice Trail and climbers' trails, and especially Sand Beach. There was a water rescue underway at Thunder Hole (fortunately, we discovered later from people on a later bus who saw the events unfold, the man in trouble was rescued successfully). 

Once at the stables, we were finally able to soothe our ringing ears by getting away from the annoying couple, who by then were trying to figure out how they could sign up for a carriage ride ("So do we have to bring our own horse or what?!" the goofy guy exclaimed). I don't know if they ever got their carriage ride since they are generally booked in advance.

We began the steep climb on a carriage road spur up to the carriage road itself, where we then made a sharp left turn and headed toward the coordinates I had marked for a set of stone steps that formed the top of the lower section of Van Santvoord. Before heading down, though, I wanted to check out the upper section just a bit to see how it might have changed since we were last here. There have indeed been some changes. I only saw two cairns where before it was quite well marked on the lower section. Once you get to the steps it's easy to follow, but finding the steps from the beginning was a challenge.

I descended again to the carriage road and then headed down the steps, which are a little tricky at first, but once I got down below them it was relatively easy to walk around. A stream winds through this area, and I ended up crossing it a few times in my attempts to find any sign of a trail, more steps or stonework, cairns, etc. 

Notice that I said "attempts." Sad to say but I didn't find much of anything other than that first set of steps. I noticed one rock placed atop another in an open, central location and I would bet that was a cairn, but no matter where I looked I could not spot another one, nor did I see any signs of graded land or anyone having walked there. I did spot a park boundary marker while I was walking around. 

On my way back to the carriage road, after determining that I needed more information and would have to come back, I made my way to the boundary marker and took some photographs and a GPS waypoint. Then I crossed the stream again and took a few more steps upward ... and I have no idea what made me look down at that point, but I saw a brown pattern that looked at first like some kind of braided cord. But of course, it was a snake! Right at my feet. It was so amazing that he was just there at my feet in the middle of the woods, and I hadn't even been looking for snakes today. 

I took a few quick photos with my phone because I fully expected him to skitter right off. He didn't. I got my camera out and took a few photos with that. Then I moved a branch off of him so I could get a better view. He still didn't move. At this point I was a little worried that he was dead, even though he looked perfectly plump and alive. I gently stroked his back and it took a few seconds, but he eventually shook himself into motion, raised his head, and flicked his tongue a few times. Then he sat still again, and posed for more photos. What a sweet, gentle snake! It was a beautiful, small maritime garter snake, and such a beautiful encounter.

I hoisted myself back up to the carriage road and found Rich, who had been wandering a bit in search of photographic subjects. I reported on my findings (or not-findings), and then we continued west toward Jordan Pond. It has been a dry year here and we didn't see much other than a few fungi and _Monotropa hypophytis_. We got to Jordan Pond House right as the bus to the visitors center was arriving, so we didn't have time to poke around.

Supper tonight was the simple pizza we'd been looking forward to all day. We got a medium pie with half pepperoni, half onion, and sat in a booth upstairs. We also ordered two large Alagash Whites again ("These peps are making me thirsty!")

With no room for dessert, we just wandered around the waterfront a bit after eating, and Rich practiced his street photography. As we were passing one of the hotels on West Street, what passed by but a Dodge van with Wisconsin plates. Could it be? YES, it was them again!!!
