This morning was the coldest feeling morning so far - heavy fog or cloud cover and temps in the low 50s. Brr! At least it wasn't raining or very windy. We had no trouble getting a table at the Friar this morning. Breakfast was as usual delicious and very large and filling! Rich and I both got the smallest and simplest thing on the menu, two eggs, meat, home fries and toast. Dad got the parfait breakfast, which was basically the same thing but with the addition of a yogurt and granola parfait. Great food and conversation with a couple next to us who were visiting from Virginia. Somehow they had found out about Man O'War Brook and were curious about the waterfall there. We told them about the road to hike out there and then we got into some of the other history of the island. Very interesting and pleasant conversation.

Our planned hike for the day was at Beech Mountain. It was still cloudy and chilly when we left and even colder when we got to the other side of the island. We stopped along the way at the farm stand, which fortunately was open (we always seem to miss their open hours/days) and it was well worth the stop. Rich found a cheddar and a goat cheese for us, I found some jams for us and Elaine and Dad found seedles blackberry jam and of course, sticky buns! They also had really nice breads from Old Dog Bakery nearby. It would be a great idea to get a baguette and some butter or cheese, maybe tomatoes, from here, and take them up to Beech Mountain for a picnic!

There was only one spot left in the parking lot when we arrived, fortunate for us there was one because there is nowhere else to park! No parking along roadways, no extra lot, etc. It was chilly enough when we began hiking that I eneded my Houdini jacket and dad was decked out in pants and a rain shell. Rich brought pants with him but din't need them. 

The hike to the summit is short and steep and mostly wooded, with a few short stretches across open ledges. Passed through beech, hemlock and laurel. Before long we were on the summit ledge, and before reaching the fire tower we had to stop for the one remaining URI survey mark, BEECH, that we had yet to find. It was set in 2011 and was in excellent condition if you can ignore the goofy stamping. 

The fire tower was neat and dad climbed part of the way up, but it wasn't open (as usual). It was also very windy up there, he said. The summit was busy but most peopel dind't stay too lng adn were relatively quiet. We shared the reaining apple coffee cake from yesterday, some peanut butter crackers and a banana , and some fun conversation before starting back down the lnger, but gentler southern slope of the mountain.

This area truly does look otherworldly, as a hiker we passed commented! Moss and fern covered boulders, lichen in every shade of green imaginable, fungus, musrooms, and the constructed trail features like steps that blend right into the landscape, helped along by scattered needles and fallen small trees all around. We all loved this part of the trail, as well as the hike back on the Valley Trail, which was similar in atmosphere but much easier hiking as it is relatively level and not as rocky (although it is very rooted in spots).

We took our time and enjoyed our hours here! We still had some time in the afternoon to rest, too, before dinner time.

Dinner at Red Sky was amazing as usual! We arrived a few minutes before 5:30, after buying some different cheeses to try at the cheese shop on the corner. We were seated right away and we all appreciated how they spaced everyone out as they arrived. It makes for amuch more pleasant experience for the early parties and also as the evening goes on, because at least if you have someone annoying next to you, at least they probably won't be there for the entire time.

We started with martinis (for our special occasion!) and the salmon mousse and  bread and then appetizers, which this time were the smoked salmon for dad and salads for me and Rich - sailor's salad for him with apples and mustard vinaigrette and house salad for me with cucumbers and sesame ginger dressing. Rich and I both had the tagliatelle with chanterelles, cherry tomatoes, and leeks and dad had the chicken, which he simply must get every time! We talked abotu some old TV shows, which was inspired by the fact that the guy next to us looked like Ducky from NCIS. And then some new ones, like the Masterpiece Mysteries that we have been watching.

The food was fantastic and just the right amount. We even had a little room left for dessert, which was bourbon vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce for R and gingerbread for me and dad. Every bite was perfect! Slow drive back but no Yanni music playing this time. We'll save it for another evening.
