It took a significant amount of digging, but I finally found the clue for the Panther Swamp letterbox I found on July 29, 2005. I have photos from that day, but really nothing else about it in my notes or email, and I was hoping that I could at least find the clue. I finally did, at http://www.letterboxing.info/box/silentdoug/pantherswamp.php (linked from https://www.letterboxing.org/boxes/view.php?boxId=1648).
I’ll paste it here in case it completely disappears at some point.

The natural area where this box is located is adjacent to a park of great promise, located 10 miles north of Canadensis and 12 miles south of Hawley, on PA Route 390. The Park Office is at the southern end of the park on Route 390; trail maps are available here or usually at the trailheads. To get to the Park from Interstate 84, take Exit 26 and turn on to 390 South. After a hundred yards or so, you'll see a sign for the the natural area on your right; immediately turn left into a very small parking area at the trail head of the Egypt Meadow Trail. Here begin your quest.
Professor Somerville strode to the front of the classroom looking as bedraggled as ever. The stack of papers crooked under his right arm rebelliously refused to stray from their precarious perch, and the Professor dropped the pile onto the table without disturbing the order of the documents whatsoever. As the students began to hush, Somerville rummaged through his pockets and placed various contents onto the tabletop -- a jeweler's loupe, three fountain pen nibs, an Eisenhower silver dollar, a page torn from The American Zoologist, and, finally, a one-inch stub of chalk.
With chalk in hand, Professor Somerville turned to the blackboard and wrote in large letters:
FELIS CONCOLOR
The class fell completely silent as Somerville turned and scratched at his white beard. As chalk dust fell onto his necktie, he addressed the students for the first time that morning.
"Who can tell me what animal is this? Someone? Anyone?"
Marcy Briggs, an overambitious sophomore from Schenectady, raised her hand. "A member of the cat family?"
"Is that a question or an answer, Miss Briggs?" answered the Professor. "You are correct, nevertheless. The family Felidae under the order Carnivora is the broad classification of cats, big and small. And while the genus Panthera encompasses lions, tigers and leopards, the genus Felis contains smaller cat species such as Felis catus, the oh-so-common housecat and Felis rufus, the bobcat. Which brings us back to Felis concolor."
The students, as one, averted their eyes from the Professor's gaze.
"Felis concolor is the panther, my underachieving students. Also known as the cantamount, the puma, the cougar, the mountain lion, or, in certain Pennsylvania college towns, as the nittany lion."
The students laughed at the expense of their intra-state rivals.
"Personally, I prefer 'panther.' The panther typically stands 100 to 150 centimeters tall, weighing between 70 and 100 kilos, with a tail up to a meter in length. Their short, coarse coats range in color from yellowish brown to grayish brown, with lighter fur on the throat, chest and belly. The so-called 'black panther' -- the animal and not the revolutionaries...."
The Professor waited for the students to laugh, and when none was forthcoming, continued straightaway. "Well, I suppose that's before your time. The black panther is not a separate subspecies, but simply any of the large cat family with melanistic coloration. Further, no melanistic panther has ever been found. Any photos you may have seen of a 'black panther' are likely of a black leopard instead. And no pink panther has ever been found in the wild, either."
At this, the students laughed, if feebly.
The Professor continued his lecture. "Panthers prefers dense cover and rugged terrain, and can range as far as 40 kilometers in a single night in their search for food."
"Their meal of choice is venison, moose, or caribou, but they also enjoy voles, squirrels, mice, muskrat, porcupine, beaver, raccoon, striped skunk, coyote, birds, and the occasional poultry, calf, sheep, colt, or pig. In their ecosystem, panthers are top predators and help to balance the population of wildlife. Perhaps if panthers still ranged in our state, we wouldn't have such a problem with deer populations expanding into the suburbs, for instance."
From the back row, Shawn Rolen, starting tailback on the university's first string, raised his hand. "If panthers don't range in Pennsylvania, where do they live? And why not in Pennsylvania?"
"Ah, Mr. Rolen, a very good question. Until the 1800s, the panther could be found from coast to coast in North America, from southern Argentina to northern British Columbia. But the settlers found the panther to be troublesome to their cultivation of livestock, so the animals were eventually hunted into exinction in the eastern United States. They still can be found today in the western states, and a population of 'Florida panthers' still roam in that state."
"Here in Pennsylvania, the last panther was killed in Susquehanna County in 1856. It was mounted, and you can find it currently on display at Penn State University. In the rest of the eastern U.S., the panther was gone by the early 1900s. Felis concolor was officially declared 'endangered' in the eastern US in 1973 -- a bit too late to do any good."
"That is not to say that the panther was gone for good. There have been several confirmed panther sightings in many eastern states -- consisting of finds of panther scat or tracks, photos or videos, or the actual bodies of animals -- as well as thousands of unconfirmed first hand reports. Here in northeast Pennsylvania, there have been unconfirmed reports of panthers in the wild, but no concrete evidence. Although, once, personally, I did...."
Here, the Professor's voice faltered. The crowded classroom again fell silent. Would they be privvy to another of the Professor's tales of adventure?
"What happened, Professor Somerville?" Lance McDowell knew he was taking a chance in urging on the Professor, for if his encouragement didn't work, they'd be back to a lengthy taxonomy discourse even sooner.
"It was a humid August evening," began the Professor, "and I was exploring the swamps of northeast Pennsylvania."
McDowell elbowed his pal in the next seat and gave him a sly smile.
The Professor continued with his reverie. "I had just started out on the trail towards Egypt Meadow lake when I came across the unmistakeable, distinctive tracks of a panther -- four toes with no claw impressions, approximately 4" by 4", with a three-part pad. They were fresh, which meant that the animal was actively seeking his next meal. Panthers are most active at dawn and dusk, when deer are feeding. The tracks were so clear, it was almost as if they were a sign pointing me due south.
"I followed the tracks and they soon seemed to turn to the left, but it was a false lead -- I continued on straight ahead as the tracks began to take me uphill at a gentle slope.
"About fifteen minutes after I had started on the trail of the panther, the path began to lead downhill. And then I heard it -- the harsh scream of the panther. Imagine the amplified call of a ninety-pound housecat and you've got a good idea of what I heard. It echoed through the woods and seemed to be everywhere at once; how could I fix on its location? And how close was the animal? It was hard to judge. You must not forget that panthers won't hesitate to attack a human."
The Professor paused for effect. Audrey Rich, Kappa Delta's rush chair, audibly shuddered from her seat in the front row.
"The tracks turned to the right off the well-worn path, and led me up to a rocky ledge, probably 100 feet off the trail. There seemed to be a plateau or ridge above the ledge -- who knows what I might find on the other side?
"I carefully made my way up to the ledge. The tracks ended abruptly at the southern face of the ledge, near the eastern edge. Suddenly, a vertical split in the face caught my eye, and hidden behind a few pieces of rock, I was suprised to find...."
Suddenly, the bell rang, signifying the end of class. Several students rose out of their seats with surprise at the noise.
The startled professor stuttered, "Ah, well, I see we're out of time. We'll have to continue next time." He began to collect his effects from the table and deposit them in his jacket pockets. "Class dismissed"
Did the Professor ever find the elusive Pennsylvania panther? And did he make it out of the swamp in one piece? Did he backtrack to his original starting point? Or did he continue south to the Bruce Lake Trail, eventually meeting up with the Snowshoe Trail to trek north back to the trailhead of the Egypt Meadow Trail? Explore for yourself and discover the answer....
Notes:
The park is open year-round, but hunting is permitted during the appropriate seasons in parts of the park. Take proper precautions or avoid the area during hunting season.
Several unconfirmed panther sightings have been made in this area of Pennsylvania as recently as December 2003. One occurred on Route 390 near the park, another was filed from Candensis, and a third was reported about 30 miles north of Promised Land. Keep your eyes open!
There's no inkpad in the box, so be sure to bring your own.
Replace the box carefully in its hiding place after you've stamped in.
