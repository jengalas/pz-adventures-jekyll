Sadly, today is our last morning in the Keys. We have begun calling the Old Town Bakery "The Cohen's of Key West" in reference to the awesome Cohen's Bakery in Ellenville, NY. And not to anyone's surprise, we had to stop there once more this morning for some breakfast goodies. Today we chose two Danishes—a raspberry cheese and an apple cobbler.
