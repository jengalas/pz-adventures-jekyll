Sadly, today is our last morning in the Keys. We have begun calling the Old Town Bakery "The Cohen's of Key West" in reference to the awesome Cohen's Bakery in Ellenville, New York. And to no one's surprise, we had to stop there once more this morning for some breakfast goodies. Today we chose two Danishes—a raspberry cheese and an apple cobbler, to go with our standard tea and coffee. At the bakery, I also purchased one of their souvenir t-shirts in electric turquoise, the design featuring one of Key West's iconic roosters.

Before checking out from Ibis Bay, I noticed some unusual types of honey in the little gift shop in the lobby, and ended up buying two small jars: one of seagrape honey, and one of joewood honey.

Bahia Honda is a state park that has been on our list from the beginning. Rich visited the park years ago, and I always wanted to see it for myself. It made for a perfect stop as we headed northeast out of the Keys. The park lived up to everything Rich had been telling me about it!

First, we explored a section of the old Bahia Honda railroad bridge that remains as a viewing platform. It was _very_ hot in full sun on top of the platform, but we hung out there for quite a while enjoying the views over the ocean. We saw a shark swimming in the water, and talked to a couple from Indiana who were visiting their daughter, who now lives on Big Pine Key.

The bridge was a benchmark bonanza, too: we found three markers right on the bridge itself, and another one a bit later when we were exploring beneath the bridge. In that location, we also spotted a ray swimming very close to the shore.

Our next stop in the park was the nature center. Outside, we ran into two rangers, and we figured this was a good opportunity to ask where the old tackle shop and administrative offices were (this was mentioned in the description for the last benchmark on our list). They were happy to direct us to the building. First, though, we took a walk through the nature center, which was pretty neat. They have an underwater webcam set up beneath the new Bahia Honda (highway) bridge, and we watched the stream on the monitor in the center for a little while. We saw a wide variety of many kinds of tropical fish swim by. When we'd had enough (for now), we found and recovered the benchmark at the park administrative office.

Finally, we spent some time at the beach. We're not typically beachgoers, but it's Florida in February, and we were craving as much sunshine and warmth as we could get! The water was awesomely warm, and shallow - at over 100 feet from the shoreline, we were just barely up to our thighs. We spotted some neat algae and sea grass, and just generally had fun wading back and forth. It was like a giant bathtub (one featuring aquatic plants). Overall, we had such a great time at Bahia Honda.

By now, we were getting hungry for lunch. We couldn't resist going to Brutus again! And as before, it was ridiculously delicious. We had the shrimp melt and shrimp tacos, of course with their perfectly brewed iced tea and crispy French fries alongside.

After stuffing ourselves, we made the long drive off the Keys and toward the Everglades. Once we reached the National Park, we first stopped at the Ernest Coe Visitors Center. It was around 4:30pm, and we were happy to see that the center was still open, although the gift shop had closed for the day. We were able to watch a short movie about the park, and view the nature exhibits.

Driving deeper into the park, we stopped to hike a small portion of the Long Pine Key Trail. We didn't see much wildlife other than a red-bellied woodpecker, but the shaded trail was cool and peaceful.

Continuing on a bit farther, we found another benchmark (S 234) at the intersection of a road that leads toward KARR, a triangulation station that we're also interested in searching for. It was getting dark, so we'll leave the recovery of S 432 and KARR for tomorrow. We headed out and began to make our way toward our hotel in Homestead, spotting two wood storks along the way.

The Hotel Redland was really quite impressive. The owner, Mark Bell, has done a great job updating it while maintaining its historic old-Florida feeling. We also, of course, really appreciated the thematic nods toward railroading. Speaking of that, we had been looking forward to eating in the hotel's restaurant, the Whistle Stop, but were bummed when we learned that it's closed on Mondays. Well, we were still full from lunch anyway, so we ended up just purchasing a few snacks and drinks from the nearby Publix supermarket ... along with some guava pastries for tomorrow's breakfast.
