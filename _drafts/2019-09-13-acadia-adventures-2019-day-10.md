Our eighth m00siversary!!! Today is dad's last full day here so we planned a longer hike to somewhere none of us have ever been - Cedar Swamp Mountain. Another goal was to visit the plane crash site there since we've heard about it for years but never ventured there.

The weather cleared overnight and by morning it was cold, in the 40s. Brrr! But with the sunshine, it actually felt as warm as yesterday's low 60s with heavy cloud cover. The walk down to Sunrise Cafe for crepes was warm enough and we were hungry enough by the time we got there. Rich and I shared the veggie crepe and Dad had his usual banana, strawberry and Nutella crepe (I had some of that, too). The cruisers were just starting to come ashore while we were eating and didn't interfere with our meal at all. The shop was busy, but there were only two other tables of people eating. Mostly people were stopping in for coffee or something quick to take out.

The Island Explorer doesn't run the Brown Mountain route in the fall, so we had to drive. Fortunately there were still a few parking spots left when we arrived at the gatehouse parking area. While there we conversed for a few minutes with some people from Raleigh who had been rethinking their plan and wanted to know if they could drive down to NEH instead and hike up Sargent via the Asticou area. They could, we said, although it would be a tougher hike and would involve some walking on the road. Turns out they had confused the carriage roads with the Park Loop Road, which they didn't want o walk on. Once they discovered they could walk on the carriage roads to intersect with the trail, as we had planned to do, they were pleased and decided to take that route. We talked to them again for a few minutes at the start of the carriage roads, but they were hiking quickly and we never saw them again.

We hiked up the Sargent South Ridge trail from the point where it intersects the cariage road. It's about 1.4 miles from here and it's trickier than it may appear, being a long south ridge trail - these are generally gradually sloping. This one is a bit rockier with some ups and downs, almost completely wooded until it nears the spur trail to Cedar Swamp Mountain where there are some open ledges with views across to Penobscot.  Really beautiful trail, especially if you take your time and look around. 

we took plenty of little breaks along the way and made our way gently to Cedar Swamp Mountain, which is just 200 feet or so from the South Ridge trail (but it is blazed and cairned and easy to follow). We enjoyed the fabulous views from this little-visited peak (which we had all to ourselves) for a few minutes, but we knew we would be back soon. First we wanted to try to locate the plane crash site. It's just a little more than a hundred yards from the summit and if you go north from the summit ridge you'll see a herd path descending into the woods. we simply followed this and very soon saw something white through the trees. We had found the wreckage! It was a somber site and frankly surprising that it is still here in what appears to be original condition. Seat pieces were probably the most poignant.

We were unsure how we were going to return but we wanted to make a loop hike if possible. Rich suggested trying the Amphitheater trail down to the carriage road and this sounded good to all of us. The section of the Sargent south Ridge trail down to the Amphitheater trail is quite rocky and rough, as is the Amphitheater trail itself. We really enjoyed the challenge, and the trail wasn't overly long, just right. Toward the end it began to follow [___] brook where it became, as most of these trails do when they follow brooks, very rooty and rocky although it was level, which helped a bit. What I really loved about this trail is that it takes you underneath the Amphitheater bridge, crosses the brook and then back up the other side of the bridge to reach the carriage road. Very scenic and an interesting, unexpected twist!

By now it was mid afternoon and the carriage road was nearly in full shade - and it was very chilly! We had avery pleasant stroll back to the car, even though my fingers were frozen by the end. We decided everyone was too tired after 5.5 miles of hiking to walk to dinner so we chose somewhere we could drive to - Jack Russell's. We had also wanted to see if we could talk to Tom St Germain, so that was another draw. The meal was decent, if pricy for what we got. Dad and I both had fish & chips and R had crab cakes. They had the Octoberfest beer and I had the blueberry ale. None of us had room for dessert at that point, but we ended up drivng over for ice cream one more time - couldn't resist! Dad and I both got the cranberry bliss and Rich got his favorite maple walnut. Back to the room early to warm up!!!
