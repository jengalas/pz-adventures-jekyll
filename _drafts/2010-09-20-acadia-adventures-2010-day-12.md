Climbing Cadillac

took about 35 minutes in the morning, after I finally got ready (after breakfast and short walk on the Shore Trail with Alphonse) and decided to do it.  Alphonse stopped once so I beat him to the top.  Too bad R couldn't try it this time.  :(  The ride DOWN was even harder because of the insane wind.  I could barely stay on the road.

Then we parted ways with Alphonse so we could have the rest of the day to ourselves.  Went back to the room for a little while to change, then went to the visitors center to see if he did stop there; found him in the parking lot.  Then continued on to Lake Wood.  We were able to find an easy trail to the large set of ledges, where we sat for a long while in the sunshine and had some snacks.  Finally some peace and quiet!

Then we went to the Beech Mtn parking area to hike Canada Cliffs. This was a great hike as well, relatively easy but with some large steps and mild rock scrambles.  A few nice views and a look at the Beech Mountain fire tower, which we both thought was a BM but apparently is not (but check USGS sheets).  Got a little confused, but eventually found our way back to the other side of the parking lot.

On our way to SWH, decided to look for a couple BMs (stopped on the road out of Beech Mtn to look at the datasheets). First one was supposed to be on a corner of 102 and road leading west; couldn't find any kind of outcropping in the small area of woods there.  Second was supposed to be in someone's yard and again, no outcropping was visible although it was a really bad time of day with lots of traffic and people around, so we didn't even feel comfortable looking.  So we continued on to SWH.  Changed in the car, then went to wine shop to buy another bottle of the pear wine for my mother.  Then went to supper at Red Sky.  Had a wonderful time on the way home listening to Buddha Bar music.  Then went into town even though it was freezing, got gelato at the country store and R's milk shake at CJ;'s from the guy who makes them the right way.  Forgot to buy a moose sticker for the utility box so that we could watch it all year in the webcam!  :(
