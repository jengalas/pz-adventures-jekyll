AZ MK, RM 1 and RM 2 of CZ1824 (POST) in Saguaro NP East.  Had trouble with GPSr in beginning but eventually found everything!

Tanque Verde Greenhouses closed for holiday, which I should have expected. 

Visitor Center downtown: no vortex hats for R and no XL t-shirts for Alphonse.  They sent us halfway around town supposedly following the "blue line" to another artists' marketplace where they supposedly sell the t-shirts.  No surprise, that place was also closed.

Wanted some more activity for the day even though we couldn't decide on just what.  Went over to SNP West to attempt the Surveying the desert cache, which is actually an NGS benchmark (CZ0717).  We hiked in from Golden Gate Road toward/along the abandoned road that was sort of described on the geocache page and eventually found the mark (it was not hard to find, just a long and hot hike to get there, but we enjoyed every minute!).  Then we decided to hike toward CZ0718 . What's one more mile?!  Well, it's actually two out and back, but we were up for the challenge. After finding that one, we followed the trail and our tracklog back to the road.  I was christened by a teddy bear cholla along the way!

Found CZ0716 along Golden Gate Road near a nice stand of saguaro, and then the long drive in the rattletrap to Sandario Rd.  Once there we found the mark across from the trailhead (CZ0721) decided to walk the 0.7 miles in toward CZ0720, so we got the whole set!

It was a relatively ("very" by AZ standards) cool day but of course 100% sunny, so it was perfect for hiking.  Several times along the way I had to "water the cactuses," for which I'm sure they were very thankful!

Supper was very informal but delicious at Taqueria Pico de Gallo.  (We couldn't decide between that and Billy Bryants BBQ, which we should try another time.)  It was a real dive but the tacos were great, made in thick handmade corn tortillas! Overall we ordered 2 carne asade, 2 fish (delicious!), 2 shrimp, and 2 chicken tacos (also great!) and horchata.  We had a fruit cup for dessert.
