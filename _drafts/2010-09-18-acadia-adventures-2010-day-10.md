Breakfast: After waiting forever for Alphonse (who overslept) we finally got into 2 Cats around 9:30. Had granola with fruit. R had pancakes and crispy bacon.  Alphonse had 3 cherry garcia pancakes.
Lunch: Lobster rolls (with chips and grapes), popovers at JPH!  Blueberry tea, coffee, water
Supper: 3 small pizzas as Rosalie's: plain, sausage and pepperoni with lots of bubbles in the crust!  Shipyard ale. Papaya heat (HOT!) and blueberry basil sorbet from MDI Ice Cream for dessert, sat in the park to eat (Alphonse had "bucket of truth": vanilla ice cream with caramel swirl and pecans.)

Waited around on the corner and on Cottage Street for Alphonse.  He didn't show up but finally called around 9:15. A few minutes later saw him drive right by the intersection and then eventually turn onto Holland Ave. 
Ride past Eagle Lake, to Bubble Pond, to Jordan Pond and then to JPH, after eating then a little walk on the nature trail and back to the carriage roads. Back past Jordan Pond, bridges "tour", to Eagle Lake and then back to the cars.

Drive up Cadillac.  Wandered around on the summit looking at views, then checked out the shop briefly. (Saw old guy soaked by Old Soaker soda!) Rosalies for supper, guy who somehow knew we were cyclists ("am I still wearing my helmet?")
