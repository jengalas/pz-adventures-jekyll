JRO's use of the phrase "in heavy woods" in his description made me a little hesitant; he seems like a pretty tough guy, so I was afraid I'd be entering a nearly impenetrable thicket. But thankfully, it wasn't too bad - especially once I found the very short path leading directly to the mark from the road shoulder. The only hazard there was a thorn bush that was easily avoided. Of course, when I first approached the mark, I came in from the side road near the cemetery where Rich had parked, and those woods were thicker! But it was easy enough to spot the ledge from a distance, and fortunately the top of the ledge was completely clear of moss and debris, so the mark was easy to spot and photograph. I tied some flagging tape around two nearby trees to help indicate the mark for future users.

After that relatively quick benchmark recovery, we turned around and headed back toward Southwest Harbor. We had wanted to scout out Peter Trout's Tavern along Shore Road for a possible lunch or supper spot (not for today, but for some time in the future). It's a good thing we hadn't planned on eating there today, because it looked busy and there wasn't a single available spot in the parking lot. Rich commented that this building had been the original location of the Mexican restaurant XYZ, which has been out of business for years now. 

We continued on along Shore Road toward The Moorings, where Rich said he'd had a nice meal many years ago. I knew we had looked into it recently and found that they no longer have a restaurant, but we wanted to see if the inn was still in business (apparently it is).
