This morning Rich said he was craving oatmeal, and it was to the point that he was even willing to try one of the flavored instant oatmeal tubs available in the hotel lobby. "I wish they had plain ones," he said. I told him that they do! I noticed some "classic oatmeal" tubs by Bob's Red Mill the other day. So that's what we ended up having for breakfast. It was actually really good, in spite of being instant. The oats have flax seeds and chia seeds added, and they were hearty and tasty - just could have used a bit more salt. Mine were accompanied by a banana I had left over from yesterday.

Our plan for today was to check out a few new-to-us sites in the Bass Harbor/Tremont area. The first object of interest was the causeway over Norwood's Cove that I first noticed on the map on Friday, labeled "footbridge." I realize this is adjacent to the Causeway Club golf course and country club, but somehow I hadn't realized that there was an actual causeway there, which appeared from Google reviews (and the fact that it was on the map) to be publicly accessible.

We turned onto Fernald Point Road where the sign points the way to the Causeway Club. This soon becomes a narrow road alongside the golf course, which is what we expected. But we did not expect to reach a locked gate with a sign on it indicating that only club members could drive past the gate. Hmmm ... did this mean that we could park outside the gate and walk down to the causeway? It was completely unclear. My admittedly complete speculation is that the causeway itself is town property and therefore accessible to anyone, but that this "carefully worded" sign is intended to scare people off, essentially making people think that it's private, without actually lying and saying so. But I have no evidence for that yet. In any case, although nothing actually said we couldn't park north of the gate and walk down, we didn't feel comfortable leaving the car there right next to the golf course in full view (if for no other reason than because we didn't want to risk getting hit with a stray ball).

We then tried the road to the left, which also had a strange assemblage of signs: `Public access to shore, No parking, No turnaround`. OK, so how does the public access the shore?! We drove down there only to find what appeared to be private homes (although we didn't see anyone around) and nowhere to park. We were, of course, able to turn around without much trouble.

Back on the main road next to the golf course, we pulled over to the shoulder and contemplated our next move, when two young women came along driving confidently down toward the gate. They had a Maine license plate, so we figured we'd see if they knew something we didn't, and maybe we could follow their lead.

Well, I guess they weren't expecting it either, because they stopped at the gate, turned around, and headed back past us. Rich tried to flag them down as they passed, but they just waved, misunderstanding his gesture, and drove on.

The causeway can also be accessed from the south, or so it appears on the maps, so we drove south on the highway and turned left onto Herrick Road. And that's the same way the young women's car had gone too - apparently they were attempting the same strategy. And it didn't work. They turned onto South Causeway Lane, as we unintentionally bypassed it. But that was OK, because within a few seconds, they were coming right back out again. We tried to flag them down again, but to no avail. They eventually turned left onto Clark Point Road, while we turned right and headed up into Southwest Harbor's downtown, passing by Red Sky.

The next spot on our route was Big Rocks. It took us a little while to get oriented and find the correct road (Bass Harbor Woods Road) but once we did, it was simple to locate the little parking area (just a pulloff with enough room for two cars) in the middle of a quiet, relatively sparsely populated housing development. 

The trail to the rocks is short and perfumed the entire way with balsam. It was heavenly, and particularly pronounced today, maybe because of the sunshine and the persistently dry conditions. We both loved it. After walking for about two minutes, the rocks came into view. They were honestly far more impressive than I'd expected! And so interesting - why are these three huge boulders here with nothing else similar around anywhere that I'm aware of? 

We spent some time playing in between, on top of, and around the boulders and trying to take a few photos to help us remember the experience. There is a trail leading around the back of the rocks in case you can't fit through the "lemon squeezer" so they should be accessible to most people. The rocks' surface is grippy (when dry) for climbing, but note that they slope pretty severely, more than they appear to from the ground. We had a great time here!

The only actual hike we had in mind for today was to explore the Alfred Butler Memorial Trail, also in the Tremont area. I was a little afraid this would be a local hotspot for dog walkers, but we were the only ones there today, and it was surprisingly interesting for such a short trail. It begins by passing through a very short stretch of woods scented with sweet fern, and then emerges into a solar field with several paths winding among the banks of panels. We opted to stick to the main/outer trail. After we encountered a deer on the easterly part of the loop,  the trail led us back into the woods, following alongside a tidal creek where we encountered a small frog and what we thought might have been a turtle's head poking up out of the water (it wasn't). Mosquitoes were plentiful in this area, so if we visit again, we'll use some bug spray. Otherwise, this was a very pretty and peaceful spot.

We continued following the loop, which eventually passed over a small wooden bridge and then brought us back close to the solar panels. After concluding the loop, I decided to go back up on top and map out the little trails between the panels, where I also found a picnic table and a stone bench (one of several stone benches I saw along this path) at the very top. Could be a fun place to bring a lobster roll for a picnic - but there is no shade, so plan accordingly!

On the way to search for the only NGS benchmark we had on our list for today, G 145, we noticed Archie's Lobster at the western vertex of the triangle formed by Routes 102 and 102A, and Flatiron Road. It looks like they have a nice outdoor seating area. We've put it on our list to try sometime.

JRO's use of the phrase "in heavy woods" in his description made me a little hesitant; he seems like a pretty tough guy, so I was afraid I'd be entering a nearly impenetrable thicket. But thankfully, it wasn't too bad - especially once I found the very short path leading directly to the mark from the road shoulder. The only hazard there was a thorn bush that was easily avoided. Of course, when I first approached the mark, I came in from the side road near the cemetery where Rich had parked, and those woods were thicker! But it was easy enough to spot the ledge from a distance, and fortunately the top of the ledge was completely clear of moss and debris, so the mark was easy to spot and photograph. I tied some flagging tape around two nearby trees to help indicate the mark for future users.

After that relatively quick benchmark recovery, we turned around and headed back toward Southwest Harbor. We had wanted to scout out Peter Trout's Tavern along Shore Road for a possible lunch or supper spot (not for today, but for some time in the future). It's a good thing we hadn't planned on eating there today, because it looked busy and there wasn't a single available spot in the parking lot. Rich commented that this building had been the original location of the Mexican restaurant XYZ, which has been out of business for years now. 

We continued on along Shore Road toward The Moorings, where Rich said he'd had a nice meal many years ago. I knew we had looked into it recently and found that they no longer have a restaurant, but we wanted to see if the inn was still in business (apparently it is). 

Without much else to look for this afternoon, we decided to head back to town. We spent some time reading and relaxing on the porch while drinking lemonade. We were hoping to run into Christopher at some point so we could ask him if he knows what the deal is with the causeway, and also if he has any idea what is happening at the site of the old Rogue Cafe.

We've been looking forward to this since last week: our traditional Blondihacks pizza party, just delayed by one day since we had to go to Havana yesterday. Not wanting to stuff ourselves, we just got a small house veggie pizza. I walked down to order and bring it home, coming back by way of Rodick Street, through the cemetery, and then along Mount Desert Street. 

Like yesterday, it was strangely not busy in town, particularly concerning vehicle traffic. Both days you could basically cross the street wherever and whenever you wanted, which doesn't typically happen. But the sidewalks on Cottage Street were somewhat busy with very slow-walking people, not something I wanted to get stuck behind when trying to return quickly so the pizza would still be got when I got back with it. Rich was surprised to see me coming down Holland Ave. instead of through the auto mechanic's lot!

The pizza was excellent, with a still-crisp crust and tons of veggies on top. I guess we were hungrier than we thought we'd be, because we both could have gone for one more slice. A medium pizza would have been too much, but I could have gotten one extra slice (since house veggie is also sold by the slice) and I think that would have been just right. We'll keep it in mind for next time.
