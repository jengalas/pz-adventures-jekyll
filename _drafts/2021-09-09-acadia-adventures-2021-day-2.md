We awoke just about 3 and a half hours after falling asleep in the Sieur de Monts parking lot. It was dark and so peaceful beneath the birch trees there, and even though the car wasn't the most comfortable, we both got some rest and awoke just before 6am to have some water and start our day. NPS workers showed up in two pickup trucks by 6:30 to, we assumed, begin cleaning the restrooms. We drove by after a few minutes and confirmed that's what they were doing, and then circled back around to our parking spot to wait for them to finish. Another pickup truck appeared, but that worker was tending to something at the Wild Gardens and soon left. Once the workers finished cleaning, we used the restroom again (leaving it super clean of course!) and moving on, but not before peeking inside the still closed Wild Gardens to see if I could spot any snakes or frogs. I didn't see any, but did find some Jack in the Pulpit and enormous skunk cabbage! Once Rich came out, I showed him the plants and he spotted some large mushrooms in the area too.

By now it was 7:30am, and we knew we had a long way to go before our room would be ready. We drove into town past the RV parking area (we were thinking about how we were like the van-lifers driving around looking for a safe place to park for the night). Parked on the street near Slice of Eden, happy to find out that the parking meters don't work until 9am. The new location of Slice of Eden is much larger and easier to access for us than the original one. They had a nice efficient system for ordering, and a nice selection of goodies in the case. We ended up with a salt & pepper bagel (with spicy lime cilantro cream cheese), a raspberry/cheese Danish, tea (Earl Grey) and coffee. We sat outside (it still wasn't raining) and although there were some wind gusts it was still relatively warm. 

We drove by the hotel and seeing that there was still someone in our parking spot, decided to continue on and go to the visitor center. There are some big changes there for this year, like the ranger stations where you ask questions and get park passes is now outside, and the gift shop area is only accessible from outside and has limited occupancy. The restrooms are accessible and I was surprised to find no one else inside when I used them, and that they were absolutely immaculate. We got our park pass and then decided to drive the park loop road.

It was a gorgeous morning for the drive, at least at the beginning, and there wans't too much traffic. We drove the loop [direction] passing Cadilac Mountain with their new reservations system near the end. There were a few spots of rain, some heavy, but the drive was mostly dry, just cloudy. When we paused briefly at Beaver Dam Pool, Rich asked if there were any abandoned trails on the cliffs aove. Funny he should ask, because I had just been looking at the possibility of hiking the Beachcroft trail to the saddle and then searching for the old Black & White, which would head down toward the Bicycle path and Beaver Dam pool. Worth an exploration for sure!

Rich also noted that another possibility for overnight "camping" might be at Fabbri memorial, assuming their restrooms are also open 24 hours.

Back at the hotel, we inquired about our room (noticing that it was 10:30 and the other occupants of our room hadn't yet left). They were required to check out by 11 but in any case, our rooom could not be ready for us until 3pm, or 2:30 at the earliest. Susan and Penny at the desk took our phone number and said they would call us if the room was ready earlier.

We decided to make a quick trip to the store (which was INSANE) and then go to Paddys for lunch. We wandered down West Street, thinking that they openeed at 11 and we could just walk in, but they din't open for lunch until 12 and it was 11:39. We just waited on the sidewalk and eventualy entered right at 12. It was a nice lunch on very empty stomachs. We each had a Guiness, of course, and R had a nice hamburger and I had the usual fish sandwich. They were both more than we were expecting and I coudn't actually finish my sandwich. The cole slaw was great, and the fries were decent although they were coated, which R doesn't like. The place filled up quickly, but we had a relatively quiet spot and no problems.

We returned to the hotel to find our room ready just before 2pm. We collapsed basically for the rest of the evening, which by now had turned rainy. 

(something about R talking to Brandon, and Monika showing up)
