Cafe This Way. Pothole (Pot Hole, Potholes) Trail!  Town Hill Bistro (lavender creme brulee! Is this what summoned the moose?!), drive through Park Loop Road with stop at Thunder Hole and many deer. MOOSE!!!!!!

My husband and I did (finally!) see a moose in Bar Harbor on September 17 at around 7:45pm, in the parking lot of the Cromwell Harbor Motel.  My husband has been visiting MDI annually for 40 years and had never seen a moose until Monday night.  It was a thrilling experience.  We had just taken a final drive along the Park Loop Road as is our custom on the last night of our vacation.  While driving back into town, I noticed a set of moose-like legs moving from the road shoulder into the parking lot of the Cromwell Harbor Motel.  I assumed it was a deer, as we had just seen four deer on our drive through the park—but as we passed I turned my head to check, just to be sure.  Immediately I saw the unmistakable antlers of a moose.  I exclaimed to my husband to turn the car around, because I had just seen a moose.  We pulled into the parking lot of the motel and had to swing around to the back before I spotted him again, in a strip of grass bordering the lot.  The bull moose was calmly pulling at the lowest tree branches and poking around in the shrubs.  He looked at us several times but did not seem distressed.  We watched him for more than five minutes until he slipped into the brush at the rear of the property, perhaps headed toward Strawberry Hill or the ballfield.  We still wonder whether anyone else saw the moose that night.

Hello Kate!

I’m thrilled that you’ve found my website and even more excited that you have been seeking out MDI’s abandoned trails!

First, I don’t have any information about what might have happened to the Sweet Waters stone, unfortunately. The last time I checked the spot (a few years ago) it was still there. If I’m able to get to Acadia this year, I will put it on my list and check it out. I really wish I knew more about that stone. Aside from the blog I mention on my website, I haven’t been able to find any references to it anywhere. It would be great if the park service was going to put it on display somewhere at Sieur de Monts! But I won’t hold my breath for that.

I have *a lot* of notes on our Acadia adventures (particularly involving abandoned trail finding) that I’m just starting to publish. It’s a difficult task to determine just how much information to provide to the public, as I’m sure you can appreciate. I love sharing the excitement I felt when researching and eventually (well, usually!) finding the trails, but I’m also aware that the easier I make it, the more the excitement and intrigue of that experience is diminished for others. Additionally, it’s sad but we have already seen a few cases of historical items, such as the old wooden trail signs at the Potholes/Eagles Crag intersection, being stolen or damaged. ☹

However, when someone such as yourself goes through the effort of contacting me directly and seems sincere (and already has some experience searching for lost features!), I have no problem sharing the knowledge I have, only hoping that in return the recipient will be as respectful of the locations as we are. The Potholes post is not published yet, but I would be happy give you some information!

Potholes was the first abandoned trail we found, back in 2012. (The first abandoned “place” we found in Acadia was the route of the old cog railway, but because that was never used as a trail I can’t really call it an abandoned trail.) At that time very little information was available online about Acadia’s old trails, but I remember coming across references to the Potholes Trail years before on an old map and in Steve Perrin’s book Acadia: The Soul of a National Park. It may also be mentioned in Tom St. Germain’s Trails of History; I’m not sure. Anyway, that year while we were in Maine, I came across a blog called “Hiking in Maine with Kelley” (http://hikinginmainewithkelley.blogspot.com/) in which the author gave enough information, combined with what I knew from old maps, etc. for us to feel confident in seeking it out. 

As it was our first real abandoned trail hunting adventure, we had no idea what to expect and had only a basic idea of where to look for the Potholes Trail’s intersection with the South Ridge Trail near the Featherbed. It may not sound that difficult until you’re actually up there on the mountain ridge wondering if the trail might lie just on the other side of those blueberry bushes, and in the absence of blazes on open rock ledges, how you would even know if it did! 

Fortunately (as we were soon to learn) many of Acadia’s abandoned trails are kept pretty well-marked by cairns, maintained by knowledgeable locals (and occasionally by yours truly 😊). The cairns are typically far enough away from the main trails, or obscured in some way, so people don’t stumble upon them accidentally (more on this later!)—but if you indeed get on the right track from your research, map skills, and the intuition you gain after finding a few “lost” trails, you will be rewarded with the sight of a cairn as confirmation of your success. From there, once you spot that first cairn, we’ve found that it’s usually pretty simple (but always with a few fun challenges along the way to keep it interesting) to find and follow the chain of cairns, and faintly worn paths through vegetation where appropriate, to complete the trail. 

For Potholes, I recall the exhilaration as I pushed my way through some bushes and spotted a HUGE cairn in the distance that I remember seeing in the hiker’s blog (his photos seem to have gone missing from the blog now, but I’ve attached our own photo of it). From there we followed cairns and breaks in the vegetation, and enjoyed seeing the potholes all along the ledges, as we took the trail down toward its intersection with the Eagles Crag footpath. That day we retraced our steps to the top of Cadillac Mountain, but on later trips we have used the Potholes trail to make all kinds of interesting loops on Cadillac, which I recommend—bonus being that most likely, you’ll be the only person on at least part of your hike!

I’m not sure I can adequately describe the spot where the Potholes trail branches off from the South Ridge, but I’m including a link to one of our GPS tracklogs that shows it quite clearly (this is from a loop we did using the Potholes, Canon Brook, and what we call the Dorr Mountain South Ridge extension trail (another pleasant trail that’s abandoned, but easy to find and hike). You can see where the Potholes branches off the South Ridge just south of the Featherbed, and heads southeast.

I hope this helps in your exploration! We haven’t hiked that particular part of Potholes in a few years, so I can’t guarantee that the large cairn is still there. In fact, I think I recall one of my local friends saying it was vandalized a few years ago, but I don’t know to what extent, or if it was repaired since then. I’ve attached some photos showing the cairn(s) and some of the potholes as they were on our first visit to the trail!

Concerning the cairns, I wanted to mention that there seems to be an ongoing back-and-forth with Acadia’s Ridge Runners, who generally do very good trail maintenance and education work, concerning placing cairns on abandoned trails. Some of them have confirmed that they are expected to and do remove the cairns when they find them in unauthorized locations, claiming that they might lead unsuspecting people astray and into danger on unmaintained trails. I can sort of understand, but at the same time, all the cairns we’ve found have been well enough away from maintained trails to generally be visible only to people who know about the abandoned trails and are actively looking for them. Additionally, if someone does find themselves off the main trail, isn’t it better that they have an unbroken path of cairns to follow that should at least lead them *somewhere*?  

Anyway, it sounds like you are in Acadia now(?), which is great! Please let me know how you make out and if there’s anything else I can help you out with. Chances are I may have more information/research or GPS data to share. I’m not a local, and we only visit for 12-14 days each year, but we have been doing so for many years and it does feel like a second home to us. We are unsure about this year given the restrictions on out-of-state visitors due to COVID, but we’re hoping that things will ease up by September. (Did you have any trouble yourself, or are you a Maine resident?)

Again, I hope this helps, and I hope you’re able to have (and share!) some adventures of your own! Let me know what you find!

Best wishes,
Zhanna
