Got up at 4:00am, left before 6:00. Tough drive because of rain and assholes. Went I-81 to 88 to 90/87, then to 73 and into town. Uneventful trip except for aforementioned rain and assholes. Detour on I-88. Stop at McD's for breakfast ("we have to drive through Wendy's?!")

Stopped at info center with moose weathervane, then headed into town. Stopped at The Mountaineer in Keene Valley to stock up on maps and guidebooks. Then came to motel. Room was OK. Spent some time napping and playing around once we got settled, then went to check out the town. Located some of the restaurants we had on our list. Stopped at Mr. Mike's for snack of pizza (white with broccoli) and then went to Price Chopper for some supplies. (Remember the goofball lady who screwed up in the checkout lane and then hit somebody in the parking lot!) Back to room for a while, then out to Whiteface Mountain to watch the sunset, but like the Olympic bobsled area the toll road had closed hours before. On the way we noticed, and stopped to photograph, some commemorative tablets we thought might be a virtual cache. On the way back we passed by, and noted with interest, a place called the Hungry Trout, and stopped for a few moments to explore the Wilmington Flume area. With shaking legs we stood on the open-grate bridge to capture a few photographs of the flume with Whiteface Mountain in the background. We also stopped to check out the Whiteface Ski Area, thinking there might be an alternate way to the top originating there. But our bad luck continued. Their gondola rides had already shut down for the day, and don't reach the summit area anyway. The diversion into the ski area was worthwhile, though, if only for the days' worth of laughter inspired by the prominent "PEDESTRAIN TRAFFIC" sign along one of the trails leading from the parking area. A sign at the ski area also indicated "Gas - food - lodging" which to us seemed to demonstrate misplaced priorities. Continuing on our journey back to Lake Placid on Route 86(?) we pulled off the road at another overlook to try for another view of the river. Rich happened to find a chiseled square on a boulder!

Finally back in town, we made our way to the Lake Placid Pub & Brewery, a loud and cramped establishment where we nevertheless had a good time (probably because of the good beer!) We enjoyed the Ubu Ale, Frostbite Pale Ale, and High Peaks Hefeweizen as well as chili and barbequed shrimp appetizers. We drove and walked through a few brief showers that night, but Rich didn't mind them as much as he did the one in the morning. Driving back to the motel, we noticed that some of the streets in town seemed unusually dark (as in, black). We got back to the room and realized we had no power! One of the storms had knocked out power to part of the town. For the next 15 minutes or so we talked with the "neighbor" and scrambled for flashlights, but as soon as we refilled our little LED lights with new batteries, the power came back on. We watched Rambo before bed, and tried eating our half-melted peached & cream ice cream, but R. didn't like it.
