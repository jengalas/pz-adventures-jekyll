Walk this Way cache log:

The first stage took us a few moments (it helps to read the cache page; apparently we haven't learned our lesson yet).  We spent a moment looking out over the marsh from the lookout platform, then descended and hopped back on our bikes.  The pet cemetery was eerie but quite an interesting find along the way back to the main trail.

A quick ride (north?) brought us to the cache itself.  The ammo box was visible from the trail when we arrived (and we made an effort to camouflage it much better upon our departure).  Though there was nowhere comfy to sit, this still made a nice spot for a break, and I spread everything out on the ground.  I don't recall trading any items today, but we did take the R2-D2 travel bug to move further west.

Far from finished with the day's ride, we spent the afternoon attempting to locate the (western?) side of the canal path, which would ostensibly allow us to make a complete loop, from the north—from the bustling town of Wurtsboro.  We struck out in Wurtsboro as well, and reluctantly retraced our tire tracks back to the car.  A highlight of the ride was passing through the tunnel beneath (rt?).  The darkness, sand and loose gravel made for a nice little challenge.  I recall a discussion of ice cream on our return trip, specifically the delicious maple ice cream with fresh maple syrup that I bought (3 scoops for $0.75!) at PA Grand Canyon in 2002.

Though I'm writing this log more than 5 months late, it almost seems like yesterday that we were exploring the quiet wonders of Bashakill (except for the fact that I can't quite remember what I traded, if anything).   :I  Time flies for me now, but nothing is so fleeting, after the fact, as those special Summer days when I'm so fully involved in my experiences that time, most welcomly, seems to stand still.  I always feel there's time enough to write about them later, and there is, but it's almost sacrilege to try to recapture that beauty of August months later, because nothing I write during the Winter winds or when the leaves are off the trees is true to how I felt during those beautiful months.  
   

Basher Kill Splendor cache log:

I'm not sure what kind of "splendor" your cache title refers to, but there's definitely something out of the ordinary going on in these woods!  After a long, productive, and   fun day of exploring Bashakill WMA and part of what remains of the towpath by mountain bike, Rich and I decided there was time for one more cache before heading to Port Jervis in search of a filling (well-deserved!) meal.  We hadn't found a good way to get to this cache earlier via the towpath as we'd hoped, so we stopped by in the car on our way north to explore Wurtsboro.  Neither of us was really in a caching mood by this point, but it's hard to resist when a cache is only 400 feet away.  We parked and ventured into the woods.

Immediately we noticed a young man standing off to the right side of the trail, just staring straight ahead into space.  He gave us a strange look as if we were the last thing he expected to see there in the woods, and just gave a simple greeting.  We continued on our way, each with our own suspicions, and I didn't find out till a few minutes down the trail that Rich had actually seen another man behind him, this man older than the first.

We found the cache without incident, and all was in great shape inside.  Unfortunately I noticed the older man spying on us as we signed the logbook, and the younger man was pacing on the trails nearby.  I'm certain they were just "guarding" the area, waiting for us to leave, and couldn't see the cache itself, but nonetheless we took precautions to protect it and appear as though we were simply taking photos.  I didn't realize this was a letterbox so I didn't have my stamp with me, but I did stamp our cache printout with your stamp.  I traded nothing this time.  Somewhere in the midst of our duties at the cache, the men wandered off.  When rehiding the cache we made sure no part of it was exposed and that the area looked as natural and undisturbed as possible.  We then moved off in the direction of the parking area, but hung around to make sure the men didn't disturb the cache.  They didn't, but the younger man kept trolling around on the trails, mostly avoiding us.  when he did approach and Rich asked what he was up to, he mentioned something about having been fishing in this area.  Well, perhaps!  [:)]

Kidding aside, this is a very pleasant and relaxing area with (mostly) deserted trails through the woods and a pretty little beach with a view of the water and marsh.  If we hadn't been so hungry (or if we'd brought along a picnic dinner) it would've been a perfect place to sit and eat and talk.  Thanks for the "adventure" and for adding a dimension of humor and weirdness to our flawless day!

Ate at cornucopia restaurant.  Looked generic from the outside and like nothing special (I was worried it would be like Poor Boys Gourmet!) but for some reason Rich had his eye on it the first time we went by and was still interested by dinnertime.  I insisted on seeing the menu before agreeing to stop.   What a surprise--German specialties abounded and the proprietress's name was listed as a very Germanic-sounding Gisela Neunzig.  We knew they'd have good beer, too, which often seals the deal even when the food selections are questionable at best.  Table for two!

Our huge Oktoberfest beers arrived along with a basket of bread (small herb rolls, crispy flatbread and two slices of sweet cranberry nut bread).  Then came our appetizers: tender crab cakes with remoulade sauce and potato pancakes, served with applesauce.  The conversation centered around movies (The Station Agent), body piercings and general concepts of attractiveness/unattractiveness, Rich's at-work injuries, and rain showers.  For entrees we had (shared) venison medallions and sauerbraten, which came with twice-baked potato and vegetables, and mashed potato and red cabbage.  



Well, "decided" isn't actually the right word.  we were simply trying to determine the tow path's route and where we might be able to access it, since earlier in the day we'd only been able to locate part of it.  But when we pulled into
