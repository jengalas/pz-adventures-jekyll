The morning gave us heavy rain, as predicted. We were fine with that, wanting a relatively relaxed day to recover from our previous illness and the long drive. We headed to Mount Dessert Bakery to see what they had for breakfast. We weren't disappointed! While there was a short line to get in, the process was run extremely efficiently by the super friendly owner and it wasn't long before we had in hand our coffee, tea (aged Earl Grey!), sticky bun, blueberry coffee cake, and toasted bagel with veggie cream cheese. We walked back through the rain to eat on the porch, enjoying the food and conversation to start our day. 

Our quest for the morning was to find an alarm clock, because one is no longer provided in our room, and they seem to be hard to come by. Everyone just says "oh, use your smartphone!" Well, not everyone has a smartphone, and even though I do, I still prefer to have something that makes it easy for both of us to see the time at a glance. And I also worry that the smartphone alarm isn't loud enough. for that matter we could also use the alarms on our watches, but those aren't very loud either. We tried the drugstore, Cadillac Mountain Sports, Sherman's bookstore, and Hannaford before Rich finally found an alarm clock at Paradis' hardware store (note that they were also the only place we could find a cooler when we needed one a few years ago! They are great!)  

On our walk around town (by now the sun had come out and it was very pleasant) when we checked Sherman's bookstore we were surprised by the nice selection of Lego sets they carry. I would have bought the 3-in-1 crocodile-snake-frog set, but they didn't have it. As usual, they also had some nice puzzles (even some Lego ones) that would be a lot of fun to work on during rainy days.

We continued our loop walk around town, walking down by the waterfront and municipal pier where there were, again, so many people, and checked out a few of the benchmarks there. The one at the top of the boat ramp, for some reason, has its designation and date Xed out! I've never seen that before. Looking at the NOS datasheets I see that mark is unpublished but it doesn't say anything about it being destroyed. In any case, it seems strange that they would cross out the identifying information, because even if the survey data was inaccurate it could always be resurveyed.

We walked along the seawall, checked out Sunrise Cafe (which was still rather busy at 1:45pm), viewed some of the benchmarks along the seawall and the relatively new one at the "Disneyland" area, and then decided to check out the sandbar before heading back. The tide was high and there were a few nice big waves. No chance of crossing to Bar Island at this time, of course.

On our way back we picked up a 6 pack of beer at Hannaford in case we decided to get takeout from Side Street Cafe rather than eating there, and I took it back to the room while R went to the hardware store to look for the alarm clock, which he finally found there. They actually had a selection - 2 alarm clocks and a wall clock. I realized later that when I was taking the beer back to the room (no bag) I probably looked like the guy we saw earlier walking around with a 6 pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon. ("At least it's not PBR!")

After a very short rest, we headed over to Side Street Cafe very early, by around 3:30. We were hoping to catch it in a lull between lunch and dinner, and we mostly succeeded. Outdoor seating was full, but because we preferred to eat indoors anyway we were taken right to a table and had no one seated anywhere near us until we were ready to leave. Our lunch/dinner there was outstanding. We haven't been there in a few years and weren't sure what to expect, but we were both craving lobster rolls and had enjoyed them there in the past. Well, they were beyond all expectations! Along with our delicious craft beers (Peak's The Juice for me and Honey Brown for R) we had lobster rolls with a huge amount of meat, served with chips, pickle, and clam chowder. We thought they clam chowder was a strange choice for a side dish for a lobster roll, but I'm very glad we tried it. It was the best I've ever had. And the lobster roll was just unbelievable. Often I've seen restaurants advertise 1.5lb lobster meat (or whatever) on their rolls, which sounds like a lot, but they actually look skimpy. This one didn't indicate the amount, but it was truly like eating a whole lobster on the bun, and each piece was perfect. They put just a light sprinkle of Old Bay on top, which is sacrilege to some people, but I really enjoyed it nd thought it enhanced the flavor.

The waiter offered blueberry pie for dessert, which sounded great (of course) but we were a bit too stuffed at the time and had planned to check out MDI Ice Cream's selection a bit later. So we passed on the pie and continued on down the street, having just missed another very light rain shower. 

The selection at MDI Ice Cream looked great, but we wanted to wait a few minutes for our lunch to settle, so we checked out the Acadia Shops, where I bought some jams for Elaine and blueberry honey for us. 

The ice cream was a treat for us, and I was thrilled to see that they had my favorite blueberry basil sorbet. I had a baby scoop of that and Rich had a single of peach ice cream, which was also very summery and delicious. We ate them as we wandered through the park and watched a group of hummingbirds attending to a colorful planting of flowers.
