Beautiful sunny day that started out cool but not windy.  Perfect day to get some pastries and eat at the gazebo.  We got a croissant and wheat bagel with spicy cilantro cream cheese, coffee and tea and sat for a while to watch the harbor.  It got warmer by the minute and the water was calm.  No cruise ships, almost no one walking around.  We ate and talked for a long time.  Then decided to take the bus for a walk around Eagle Lake, to include some carriage road walking as well as a hike on the Eagle Lake South Shore trail.  

In the meantime while looking for a way to make a loop hike out of Beech Cliffs Ladder Trail from Echo Lake Beach, which I'm still dying to do, I discovered a comment in A Walk in the Park that there once was such a trail, that looped back gradually to the south toward the beach, but is now "abandoned." The fact that the book used quotes around the word "abandoned" makes me think that there might still be some portions of the trail that we could locate and perhaps even hike. We have spotted this trail on only one park trail map (1946) and _Pathmakers_ makes no mention of it that we have found.

We walked the carriage roads along the western side of Eagle Lake until we reached the trail.  Then we cut in toward the lake on the trail, which was wooded and mostly level and easy "carpeted" walking to start, then turned to very rocky scrambling over the middle third.  Near the intersection with Jordan Pond Carry trail the area became a bog with a wooden bride and bogwalks.  We looked around for sundews and other bog plants to no avail. The trail soon joined up again with the carriage road.  We had planned to circle the lake, but for some unknown reason the carriage road on the east side of the lake was closed.  It hadn't been announced anywhere and there was no indication of why the road was closed or if passage was still allowed for hikers.  We ended up getting the bus again at Bubble Pond and riding it to the Visitors Center.  At the visitors center we complained about how there had been no notice of the closure.  We got no real response from the rangers, other than that it should be listed among the park alerts on the website (it isn't) or that we could call in the morning for closures.

We bought the latest AMC map of the park and then returned via the next bus to the village green.  We couldn't resist stopping for ice cream!  We had cinnamon cardamom ice cream and honeydew, basil and cucumber sorbet.  Then we returned to the room to wait for my parents to arrive.  They arrived around 2:40pm, just as I was calling to find out where they were.

We took them to the top of Cadillac, where we froze in the wind, but we still did the entire loop.  Talked to astronomer at the top. Showed them the benchmark and took a few photos, then thoroughly frozen, just took a drive past Jordan Pond House (home of popovers!) and through Northeast Harbor back to Bar Harbor, showing them the moose sighting spot (Cromwell Harbor Motel) along the way.
