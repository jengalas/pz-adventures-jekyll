This Friday the 13th was also our 13th M00seversary! I had no idea what we would do today, but Rich had something in mind (I didn't know this until later). We wanted something a little heartier for breakfast, so I went down to Slice of Eden bakery and brought back a whole wheat bagel with veggie cream cheese for Rich and a salt and pepper bagel with green olive and pimiento cream cheese for me. In the meantime, Rich brought over some tea, coffee, and juice for us.

After eating and cleaning up a bit, Rich suggested that we take a walk up to Great Head, to the triangulation station where we were married! I was thrilled with the idea. He'd had it in mind all week, and was ready for the walk today. 

With no desire to try to park at Sand Beach or to hike up the steep rocky ledges and boulders from there, we parked at the lot on Schooner Head Road. The lot wasn't quite half full and we had no trouble finding a nice end spot (somehow disrupting a surly woman who was getting out of her car at the time). 

We took a slow hike up toward the peak; the back way is the easiest and most gentle by far. Along the way we noticed so many different plants, from bunchberries (without berries), Indian pipe everywhere (unfortunatley all long past its prime), Indian cucumber, light purple asters, and something in the rose family that had been infested by some insect that caused its growth to turn crested. That was something I've never seen before. We also found a fungus that appeared to be oozing out of the dead tree it was growing from. It was very smooth and rubbery to the touch.

It was a foggy scene over the ocean when we reached the ledges at the peak. Reminiscent of our wedding day, but not nearly as foggy. Still, it was the only foggy morning we've had yet this year. There were quite a few people at the top when we arrived but we waited them out and were able to take photos of us together at the tri-station, and some at the tea house and at the Great Head trail sign. 

Then came the hike back down. Both of us forgot just how steep and rocky the other seciton of the trail was. We actually remembered about the steep sections and boulders at the beach, but we thought by taking the "shortcut" throught he middle and back to the trail we'd taken up, we would miss most of it. unfortunately that wasn't true, and Rich struggled a bit on the way down. All in all, in went fine, and we will remember for next time that we should probably just take the shorter and more straightforward path up and back.

After resting in the car for a few minutes, we decided to take a drive over to the visitors center. The parking lot was packed! But the center wasn't really too busy. I have to wonder if a lot of people are parking there just to take the Jordan Pond or Park Loop Road buses, since they don't stop at the Village Green.

We spent some time looking through the books and other goodies in the park store, which is always a fun place to browse even if you don't buy anything. THe only thing we ended up buying were some dill-flavored pretzels, just because we were feeling snacky and they looked good (and were). By now the sun was out and it was very warm. We had about two hours left to just relax back at our room before dinner.

One of our traditional dinner places for our anniversary is Havana. I made a reservation a few nights ago since we were sure we wanted to go there again, and it didn't disappoint. We took a slow walk down and arrived a few minutes early, just before 4:00pm. We noticed that there is a new seating area, a deck just outside the main entrance, with three tables for two. It actually looked like it would be nice later in the evening. At 4:00, because there were no umbrellas or awning, it was too sunny and hot. 

We were the first ones there, and we asked for and got the table in the front window. (I had actually asked for this when I made the reservation online, but I never know how effective that actually is.) We started with the traditional mojitos, which are always excellent. Enrico was our server, and we've had him a few times before. He seemed to recognize us from past visits. And he was very kind and provided excellent service.

Our mushroom spring rolls (also traditional, and always perfect) came out just after the bread selection, which was a blueberry cornbread and multigrain crusty bread. The dips for the evening were red pepper hummus, rosemary-infused olive oil, and cinnamon butter. It's too easy to fill up on the bread because it's so good, so we tried to restrain ourselves.

Our entrees were delicious and well presented as usual. We had the sea bass with roasted cauliflower and root veggies and green romesco, and shrimp and scallops with saffron fregola topped with pistachio and a basil lime emulsion. Very interesting and filling ... but not so filling that we couldn't have another drink and share a dessert! For our second drink we chose a peach cocktail that was very refreshing; I would easily get one again. And for our dessert, we tried the blueberry lavender opera cake with lavender ice cream. I didn't think it would be Rich's favorite, but he encouraged me to get it anyway, and it was really good. They even wrote a dark chocolate "Happy Anniversary!" on the plate. The lavender wasn't overdone, and it was just sweet enough. Perfect end to the meal!

We enjoyed watching a few videos together for the rest of the evening, and got some rest.
