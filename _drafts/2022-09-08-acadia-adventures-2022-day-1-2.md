## Day 1: September 8

We were having trouble all week deciding when to leave on our journey. Our first thought was to try leaving around midnight like we did, successfully, in 2017. We ended up pretty close to that, leaving at 11pm. After a pretty routine morning and afternoon (if you can ignore the three solid days of nonstop rain that resulted in 4.3 inches in the gauge and persistent showers over us all morning and afternoon - *we* couldn't ignore them), we lay down for some rest around 6:45pm and planned to get up around 10. We kept close to that schedule, getting up around 10:15, having something to eat (frozen past and veggies) and leaving the house at 11pm. 

Traffic wasn't too bad, although it was heavier than during our late-night drive in 2017. Almost all trucks for the first several hours, and they were mostly behaving. A few cars joined now and then, and were coming onto the highway in greater numbers (and crazier speeds) by the time we were on the Mass Pike and 495. W took a quick detour through Vernon around 2:30 looking for coffee, but nothing was open. We continued on to the Charleton plaza East, where even the McDonalds was closed at 3:30am. (We were able to get a self-serve coffee from this weird attached convenience store that we both thought looked and felt like something from another universe or at least another galazy. SO bizarre inclding the character that worked there.) Back on the highway and it was busy but smooth sailing until the start of I-95 (Maine turnpike) where 495 ended. Right at the toll area (where we had unintentionally chosen the cash side, but it still had ezpay) We found ourselves suddenyl in this fog bank so thick it was impossible to see anything for a few (rather terrifying) seconds. It was like driving into a white wall. Fortunatlye it let up just enough that we could see and then follow the trucks coming through the ezpass side of the toll area. While there was some fog for the rest of the night's ravel it wa wispy and did not really affect visibility. Almost exactly consistent with our timng in 2017 (just one hour earlier) we reached the Kittery rest area at 5:30am. I'd had no sleep all day (could not sleep while we were resting in the afternoon and evening) and thought I would get a few hours easily while at the rest aeea. Our eye masks worked great, blocking the light that would always hit us squarely in the eyes no matter where we parked or how we angled the car. And I was veryr comfortblae termperature wise and at least somewhat cofortable otherwise, but simply could not sleep. Rich (having had a decent rest) woke me up around 7:15 and we headed back out around 7:40. 

## Day 2: September 9

Traffic wasn't terrible this morning, and although some fog drifted by occasionally, it was light and wispy, and caused no problems on the roads. We reached our first stop, Youngs Lobster Pound, at 10:00am. Rich ordered two lobster rolls for us, as usual, and we wandered around the dock while we waited for our food to be prepared. I couldn't resist looking for snakes (sea serpents?!) among the rocks, even though I knew I was very unlikely to see one.

The early September sun warmed us up quickly—finally we had perfect weather for this venue! Other times we've visited this lobster pound we've had to deal with fog, clouds, rain, and strong winds, so the weather made this morning's visit a delight.

Our lobster rolls were ready after about ten minutes, and we took them to the picnic tables on the waterfront platform behind the lobster pound. We were starving by this point! The rolls were bursting with fresh lobster meat, and they were such a pleasure to bite into and enjoy as our first Maine meal of the year.  Served as always with a bag of Utz kettle chips and some sliced pickles, the rolls were a perfect breakfast! Along with our lobster rolls, we finished up a bottle of mandarin orange-flavored Polar seltzer water. Then we continued on.

After crossing the bridge near Fort Knox followed by the bridge at Verona, and finding ourselves at the T-intersection in Bucksport where we usually turn right, Rich said, "... Let's go left." 

Exploring the town of Bucksport was a great decision! We found so many cool things here. Rich parked along Main Street and asked me if there were any benchmarks nearby. 

Obviously I had nothing prepared, because I didn't expect we would be stopping in Bucksport. But I used the little app I had developed to find that there were a bunch of landmark stations in town, a bolt with washer near what looked like railroad tracks, and a triangulation station (**`BUCKSPORT`**) at the top of a hill called Mount Olive. 

That triangulation station didn't look too far away, so we decided to take a walk toward it. Turns out it was straight uphill and much farther than it appeared from the map. So once we reached the intersection of School and Elm Streets, we changed course and headed back down toward Main Street, where we checked out a few of the old buildings and examined the post office to see if there might be any USGS marks set in its foundation. 

We had no luck at the post office, but as we came around the back of that brick building we saw a small farmers' market set up in the adjacent lot. We weren't able to buy any vegetables, but there was a man—the [Chaga Mann](https://www.chagamann.com/)—sampling and selling chaga tea. I had to try some (I've tried a sample before from my friend Mickie). In fact, Mickie is tending to my plants while we're away, so I bought a bag of chaga tea as a little thank you gift for her.

Then we crossed Main Street, heading toward the waterfront. We spotted a brick pathway that looked like a walking trail leading in both directions along the water, and right next to it, a section of abandoned railroad tracks. Could these take us to the benchmark near the old railroad tracks? 

We followed the walking path, which was so pretty and all along the way lined with plaques explaining the history of the town, the bridge, the fort, and the various prominent people of Bucksport's history. Once at the coordinates for the benchmark, Rich asked what type of mark we were looking for, and I said it was a bolt with a washer. 

"Well, here's a washer!" he said. 

"Are you kidding?" I said, thinking he had actually already found it. 

No, it was in fact just a plain washer on the ground that he happened to spot right when I said the word "washer." I kept it as a souvenir.

We continued our search around the little park where the bolt was supposedly set, but we saw nothing else that looked like even a remote possibility. We even checked the Geocaching page for this mark. Strangely enough, after no logs at all for 22 years, someone was here and logged a "Not Found" just last Monday. Weird. (And no, it wasn't Geeoh!) 

Another weird thing is that the datasheet didn't say `SCALED` or `ADJUSTED` but rather `NO CHECK`, which I've never seen before (I would expect this type of mark to be adjusted, but if not, we may have been in the wrong spot). 

Also, since the park was built beginning in 1984 and the bolt was set in 1982, it may have been removed or covered over long ago.

This town is worthy of much deeper exploration. Among other things, I think we'll come back to look for a few more benchmarks! Before leaving, we took a drive up Central Street to check out the location of the Mount Olive mark. It's in deep woods on a high knoll, but I didn't see any "posted" signs and it looks doable—with significant effort—as long as we can find a good place to park. 

Just as we were leaving town I spotted a disk on a bridge bannister. Rich pulled down into another small parking lot along the waterfront trail and waited while I photographed the disk (it was a MaineDOT mark from 2021). We really need to find out more about the history and extent of this trail!

Our trip to Bar Harbor was uneventful except for a brief section of Route 3 that had been completely stripped of pavement and is down to literal dirt. Traffic descends a steep hill and then curves back up sharply to meet the regular road surface. It was short but very weird. And I have no idea how some of the longer RVs we spotted on the road later would have handled it.

We arrived in town and checked in at our hotel at 1:55pm. Our room was ready, earlier than expected, and we collapsed onto the bed! We don't like arriving too late at Rosalie's Pizza, but we needed rest and didn't go for pizza until 5:30. Our plain pie was great as usual with two large Allagash White Ales. We ate the whole medium pizza while involved in deep conversation. Then after a quick trip to a very crazy Hannaford we came back to the room to continue our conversation and get ready for bed.
