Jeannie's for breakfast: oatmeal pancakes; two scrambled eggs, oat toast, bacon.  Bought the rhubarb spread to take home.  Nice morning and it started to clear up nicely as we got back to the room.  We headed to the Bubble Pond parking area to begin our West Face Trail climb.  As soon as we turned onto the Park Loop Rd., the fog and mist immediately appeared, which would be the theme for the day.  Tough climb on wet rocks (treacherous in spots) that took us 2.5 hours, but we made it just in time for the wedding.  Talked with woman at the top as we froze and got soaked in the unbelievably thick fog.  Her husband was the bagpiper.  A few minutes later and we heard the rolling thunder.  Mike appeared with Jill and their entourage of biker buddies.  Listened to the bagpiper as we descended to a small niche where it was warmer (well, less windy) and dry. Monika and Brandon appeared as well as quite a few other townsfolk. Ceremony was even shorter than ours, then Mike invited everyone to Mainely Meats on Rt. 3.  We didn't go but did ask Monika and Brandon for a ride back down the mountain, otherwise we'd have to take the bus (that adventure will have to wait for another time) since our plan of hiking back down the south ridge trail wasn't so appealing in the heavy fog. They couldn't take us since they had only their 2-seater BMW convertible (we learned that it was still warm and sunny in town, but they had to put the top up by the time the reached the bottom of Cadillac).  They found us a ride back to Bubble Pond with two spunky local gals, Nancy (with the spiky hair!) and Mary, who were telling dirty jokes all the way.

Surprise adventures for the afternoon: tea (blueberry/coffee for R) at Jordan('s) Pond House, complete with popovers ... we needed this in order to warm up!  And then we checked out the rockslide that has closed Duck Brook Road.  It didn't appear to be anything major, but if the entire road is eroded or undercut that may be the reason for the closure.  In any case, we were able to come around from the other side and park as usual.  It was warm and sunny by now, and we decided to take a walk on the carriage roads down to Witch Hole Pond.  Just before returning to the car I investigated underneath Duck Brook Bridge and a "big squirrel" was tossing rock at me from above!

Dinner: Havana: lamb balls (shouldn't they be from Testes restaurant?!?!), lobster moqueca, swordfish with kalamata olive paste and quinoa tabbouleh, "seven wonders" bread (blueberry cornbread with goat cheese), multigrain bread with banana honey butter.
