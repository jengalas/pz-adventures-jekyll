After a later than usual start, breakfast at Mount Dessert bakery just for something quick. R got a slice of banana bread and I tried the blueberry coffee cake this time. We also got another blueberry cream cheese pastry for the trail. We got the usual coffee and I had green tea for a change.

Came back to the room and headed toward Barr Hill. (something about how I hadn't been able to find much about it but we had a few hints fro Angie). We parked int he lot at Seal Harbor beach and walked up Seaside Lane until we spotted the sign for Barr Hill, directly across from #9 (address on Seaside Lane, I guess). Beautiful trail!!!  This would be great fr photography. the trail is very gently ascending mostly over soft terrain, just one or two sets of steps and rocks to climb over. Took lots of photos on the way, crossed gras carriage roads, found some other roads and trails to explore. Saw pileated woodpecker. climbed higher and eventually reached the summit marked with signs (two signposts, one actually a ltitle before the summit). went out to lookout ledge and found the trail leading down to the bridle path. We weren't sure what trail to take toward the Eyrie and Madam's path but now we think it was this one, oh well. We tried the Redfield hill path, which I ran down to the carriage road and back. Great trail for running! Didn't find much other than some really weord and cool cairns, but I got my exercise for the day. Then we tried the path marked "Jordan Pond" figuring it woudl take us down to the Seaside path, which it did, although ti was a shorter path and not so scenic as the one we took otn eh way up. When we were at the Seasons path I had to pee so I followed what I assuemd was a brown trail for trail crew until I noticed it was blazed with red tape, and that it kept going in the direction of Stanley brook Road. We decided to follow it and it indeed took us to the road. There was no real parking spot or anything there si I have no idea why it is someone's shortcut, but apparently it is.

On the way back to our car we found the most perfect, huge mushroom we've ever seen. It was so perfect it looked like something plastic put there to see how many fools would think it was real. But alas it was real, and we must have found it at just the right time when it was fully open but not yet nibbled on by critters.

Dinner at Havana - beautiful as always! We have been choosing this as our last night's meal for a few years now. We started with the amuse bouche of local heirloom tomatoes and herbed goat cheese. Then the bread and mojitos (need no explanation) came. The bread was whole grain and blueberry cornbread with three sauces as usual, but there was a little change this time. Instead of the white bean dip there was a green curry bean dip. The chili oil was the same, and the butter of the evening was chive honey. We couldn't resist sharing the mushroom spring roll appetizer as always. IT is so good! Filled with mushrooms and soba noodles, fried crispy and served with aioli, green onions and soy sauce drizzle, they are always a treat. We always say we could eat at least a half-dozen apiece. Entrees were the pozole for R which was a HUGE pork cutlet on top of a stew with corn and pork shoulder, and I had the fish special which was halibut with blueberry bbq sauce and mushroom aioli on top of foraged black trumpet mushroom stew. SO good! Nothing on the dessert menu really appealed to us (I prefer the fruity desserts and there weren't any this time) so we decided to go for a little walk after our meal and maybe get an ice cream cone instead. We did - I got blueberry basil one more time, after sampling the basil ice cream and pineapple pimenton sorbet (both were great, but the pineapple was defnitely spicy - would need to be in the mood for it) and R got something that surprised me a bit, the salted Maine wildflower honey. That was great and reminded me a bit of the honey frosting I make for Earl Grey cupcakes. We took one last evning walk through town, sadly and slow, taking a photo of BEnjamin Ash's gravestone (and I think capturing his ghost!) along the way. It was a chilly night so we put the fireplace on when we came back to the room.
