Hi Zhanna, Re: your PE1825 recovery:
I believe the cabin that looked like it was three cabins strung together is Julia Child's former summer place. Not sure if it's still in the family or not but there is a book at the SWH library that, I think, her son wrote about that cabin's history. Cabin on the Rocks?? Can't remember the title but it would be an easy find at the library under the author Child.


Breakfast at Cafe This Way after being less than impressed by Tamarind. Saw surveyors at Y 144-PE0273, stopped to talk to them and found out they were doing a project for the NPS.

Went to Southwest Harbor library and skimmed through Charles Child's book "Roots in the Rock." Stopped to check when XYZ is open. Checked on Swans Island ferry schedule. Went to Lopaus Point but the LOPsters were not home. Hike on Ship Harbor trail.

Checked Red Sky's hours (open every day beginning at 5:30). Went to Burning Tree to find out what days they are closed (Mon-Tues). Relaxed and snuggled, then went for pizza. Went to bookstore where we looked through the Acadia Monuments book, then had gelato at Country Store.
