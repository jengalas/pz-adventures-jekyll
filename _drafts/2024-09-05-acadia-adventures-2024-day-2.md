All through Massachusetts the traffic was relentless until well after midnight, and even more than expected past 1:00am. But as usual, it thinned out a bit once we hit the Maine border, and we were at the rest area by 1:30am. We rested until around 6:00am, washed up (noting the full blueberry bush in the native flora garden outside the rest stop entrance!) and then got on our way again.

Traffic on I-95 in Maine was typical morning commuter traffic for the most part, not too crazy or intense, and there weren't any delays. GPS indicated that we would arrive at our planned stop, Young's Lobster Pound (for our traditional lobster roll breakfast, of course), at 9:05am, just five minutes after they opened, which was perfect. We knew we'd still have plenty of time to kill this morning, given that check-in at the hotel isn't until 3:00pm (although they typically have the room ready earlier) but this would allow for a very leisurely breakfast and also would probably mean that we'd have the place to ourselves. And we mostly did, until just when we were finishing up our amazing lobster rolls, when another couple arrived. The lobster rolls were incredibly amazing, as always. They may have contained even more lobster than usual - we were both saying there much be an entire large lobster in here! They included so much sweet, firm claw meat and also my favorite part, the meat from the small legs that is so tender and flavorful. The buttery, toasted buns and a bit of mayo and lettuce made for the perfect contrast to the meat.

While we ate, Rich looked across toward the highway bridge (looking, I'm sure, for the large ducks that were here last year as part of an art installation and are now gone), and he commented, "I wonder what that low bridge is right in front of the highway bridge. A pedestrian bridge? Railroad bridge?" I remember having noticed it last year and wondered about why it was placed so close to the other bridge and more importantly, how boats passed through since it is so low to the water. But I neglected to comment on it because we were so entranced by the ducks.

Well, this year we were intrigued, and I took a moment to look it up on my phone. It was indeed a pedestrian bridge - a footbridge - and it appeared that there were small parking areas on either end of the bridge. We planned on checking it out (lots of time to kill, remember, and this is the kind of thing we love coming across!). But first, we thought we would search for a tidal benchmark station that I spotted on the NGS map in the town of Belfast, right across the river.

Often these tidal markers along the shore require crossing private property to gain access, but this one appeared to be on the property of, or at least adjacent to, a town boathouse. That looked promising! So we drove over to Belfast, just a 5 minute drive at most, and navigated through the twisty and very busy streets of this old town toward the boathouse. The area along the shore here was indeed some kind of a town landing, boathouse, and small beach/park. We made our way over the coarse pebbly sand toward the "notable ledges" that supposedly held the series of tidal marks (two disks and one drill hole). 

The first marker on our list was TIDAL 2, and we spotted it first because it is bright blue and set vertically in a high ledge, facing right out toward the beach. Before recovering that mark, though, I wanted to look for the other one, TIDAL 7, on the next notable ledge. This was a bit trickier. The ledge was high and wet, and surrounded at its base by very slippery wet seaweed. I carefully climbed up on the ledge and looked around for a full minute before spotting the disk, well camouflaged due to its discolored and eroded state, right in front of me. I climbed back down, carefully, as the tide was coming in, and then recovered the first marker we had spotted.

I had mentioned to Rich that there was also a drill hole here as part of the tidal series, and he encouraged me to look for it. These are usually very tricky to find as they easily become overgrown, filled in with water and mud, and when eroded are very difficult to positively identify. But I thought I would climb back up, rather quickly this time as the tide was coming in rapidly, and do a quick search. After all, it was supposed to be only 6 feet from TIDAL 7! And drilled in vertically, which to us meant drilled downward from the top of the ledge.

But I didn't spot anything at the time. There was a large crack in the top of the ledge that was filled with water and mud and sprouting vegetation. I figured it was possible the drill hole was in there somewhere. Rich said that the tide was coming in quickly, so I scrambled back down the ledge, having to skirt around much farther in to the shore because the bottom of the ledge was already in water a few inches deep. Oh well, we found two of the markers, and there are some others in town to look for.

The next one on our list was at the old courthouse, next to the city hall a few blocks west of the beach. We parked and walked a few blocks through the lovely old town, noticing some interesting brick buildings along the way, and then easily spotting the old disk on the water table (top of the foundation). Actually Rich spotted it because some weeds were blocking my view, weeds which we pulled out in order to take our photos of the mark. Then we moved on to the next one in town, on the post office just up one block and across the street.

This mark, S 18, we both commented, was quite a handsome mark. It was perfectly neatly stamped and evenly shiny. 

After this benchmark bonanza, we headed down toward the footbridge. This was such a cool area! Not only did we spot one of the ducks (sort of; it was just a small cutout placed on a piece of old farming equipment, who knows why) but I looked at the top of one of the abutments and what did I see? Yes, another benchmark disk! At first I expected it to be a MaineDOT disk, but it was actually an NGS disk, T 18 RESET (2005). Interestingly, I couldn't find an entry for this marker in the database. I did find its predecessor, T 18 (PE0906) dating from 1933(?).

The bridge was moderately busy today with tourists like us, dog walkers, and cyclists. A dance was being advertised for the weekend. There are plenty of places to sit, and the answer to our question about how boats pass - there is a swinging section that sailors can request to be opened by the harbormaster. (I asked Rich if we could call and ask him to open the bridge for us. "Yes Captain, what is your vessel?" "I don't have one, I'm _on the bridge_ and I just want to see it open!")

A completely new and unusual experience for us, as always happens here! [also give some history of the bridge]

The rest of our morning and early afternoon were spent making our way toward Bar Harbor. Traffic wasn't too bad inbound, but outbound was stopped dead for miles due to construction (namely, milling and then tarring center rumble strips on Route 3).

We arrived just after 1:30pm and figured that our room wouldn't be ready yet. Althouhg it took a few minutes for Constance to come out to the lobby, she eventually did and we were able to check in. Our room was ready! This was good news because we were very tired and just wanted to relax before heading down to Rosalie's for our customary first-night pizza dinner. We were also extremely thirsty, and enjoyed a few large glasses of the lemonade provided on the hotel porch.

An hour or so of rest and we made our way to Rosalie's, where like last year, there was a line already forming by 3:45pm. I ran up to the park to pick up a few bus schedules while Rich held our place in line. A few minutes after I returned, the door opened.

Rich ordered the usual medium plain pizza and two large Allagash ales, and I headed upstairs for one of the window tables. We later moved to a booth because of the completely obnoxious loud couple that sat down at the table next to us. Entirely intolerable. But the pizza was fantastic, the beer was thirst quenching and most welcome, and the company (NOT the obnoxious people who were now across the room from us after we moved) was perfect. We talked about the possibilities for hiking up Conner's Nubble, reminisced about a few benchmarks that we'd had trouble finding (like Q 145, and M 145 which we still haven't found!). We stayed as long as we could and made the pizza and beer last as long as we could, which Unfortunately was dictated more by the loud obnoxious behavior than anything else.

A quick stop at Hannaford for some water and toiletries was the last active thing we did before collapsing into bed, watching a video (Clickspring, about watch jewels), transferring our photos off the memory cards, and writing up these notes.

Funny thing, while I was writing up the notes I decided to take another look at the datasheet for the drill hole. While it says "Drilled in vertically" I wondered if they may have meant "in the way a hole would be drilled for a _disk_ set vertically. So, actually horizontally, into the face of the ledge rather than into its top. I took another look at the photo of TIDAL 7 taken from a distance, that shows the whole ledge, and wouldn't you know it, there was the damned drill hole, drilled horizontally into the ledge.
