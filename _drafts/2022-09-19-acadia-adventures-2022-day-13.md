We expected today to be a cloudy and possibly rainy day, so figured it might work as a photography/basically rest day. We tok our time decidig on breakfast, and rather than gong for a pastry or bage at the bakery, we decided instead that we wanted the Eggs Benedict again from the Black Friar. We arrived there just after they opened at 7:30, and we were te first ones there. We asked to sit in the back room (dining room or living room, as the waitress called it).

Our server this morning was excellent, friendly and competent. We each ordered eggs Benedict (me with portobello mushrooms again and R with spinach, and we shared them so we each had a taste). They were excellent just like when I had them a few days ago, and thei home fries are excellent too. Great breakfast! It was quiet in the back room; one other couple came in just as we were finishing up.

THen came the task of deciding what e wanted to do for the day. I had in mind someting R had mentioned yesterday: walking the Paradise Hill carriage road loop near (but north of) Witch Hole Pond. That sounded interseting, particularly if we were going to have good light for photography, but it was already very sunny (completely counter to the forecast). He then suggseted maybe we could try a loop of just the grassy carriage roads around Barr Hill. This sounded very good to me, but I couldnt find a good way to get to the carriage roads that didn't invovle some (or a lot) of hiking trails. The best I could do was a route leading up the Seaside Path to the Barr Hill path, then back south on the Barr Hill Carriage Road (eastern side) to the southerm Barf Hill trail.

While I was showing R this route on my Abandoned Acadia map, he spotted some waypoints I had taken from GPSAcadia aong the western side of Lake Wood. He was interested in poking around the area and checking that out, and so our plans for the day were set!

We were the second car in the Lake Wood parking lot this morning (people returned to the other vehicle as soon as we headed down the road toward the beach). We passed the gate and headed down to the rather unimpressive gravel beach. But we weren't here for the beach - we were going to try to head to the few GPS waypoints I had gathered from GPSAcadia to see what might be left of them after 12 years.

It took some very minotr bushwhacking but we made our way to the Kane-Bridgham memorial bridge (designed by Beatrix Farrand!) and he adjacent carved memorial boulder. (Pathmakers mentions a bronze tablet memorial nearby, but I didn't see anything like that, and the Memorials of Acadia by Lenahan also mntions only the carved boulder and not a plaque. But there might be one that we simply missed.)

There was clearly no way to make my way over to the supposed "foundation" (another of the waypoits) even thoug it was ony about 75 feet from the bridge without getting very wet feet, so we decided to look for another way. There should have been a path along the western side of Lake wood anyway, which we would like to find.

So we headed back up the road toward the parking area and noticed that what we had seen on our way down but thought wasn't much, was actually very much a road! It was wide, clear, and easy to follow. We followed it until another, smaller, road or trail led down toward Lake Wood. We didn't find the few points of interest that were supposed to be here, ut we did find an easy to follow trail that led us alongside the lae, although not hugging the shoreline. It was a short distance up a ridge to the west. We followed this trail until it became completely obscured. It may well still exist, but it woudl be best for us to plot a few points further south (taken from the topo map) and see if we could pick the trail back up at some point. 

Having explored enough of this trail for today, we headed back to the road and followed it to its end (or as far as we could legally walk) at the property boundary of the National Park and Wild Iris Farm.  The road continued but we could tell that it simply led to the horse farm. We turned around and after getting back to the car, drove up the crooked Road another quarter mile to find the Wild Iris horse farm.

We had a little energy left, so we took a drive up Kebo Street toward Harden Farm Rd. to check out the old road I had seen leading west from the Gret Meadow path just north of the quarry. We coudn't park at Harden Farm Rd but we got one of the parking spots a little further down alongside the golf course. It was a quick walk to the old road, but following it wasn't easy past the first 100 feet or so. It basically devolved into grassy open area dotted with rose bushes (that were covered with oval=shaped rosehips). There was b=no road, old grade, or even hint of a path evident. I found one place that looked slightly more promising than anything else and worked my way out to the Park Loop road. We'l check the tracklog to find out if it matches what we saw on the map. 

Rich had been talking longingly about wanting a steak all week long whenever we passed by the Jack Russell steakhouse. Tonigt seemed like the perfect night to indulge that desire, and it was! They open at 4pm and as we were already finished with our activties for the day and were getting hungry, and it was already getting dark and cloudy we headed there for opening. It began to drizzle as soon as we left the room, and by the time we were seated at a second flor table by the window, it was already pouring like crazy.

The restaurant began filling up quickly and I was glad that we arrived early as we did to secure a good parking spot and a nice window table. It was busy but still mostly quiet, which we really liked. There seemed to be a party going on abive us, on the 3rd floor loft/balcony but it wasn't too disruptive.

Instead of beers, tonight we chose gin martinis, which we enjoy but almost never have. They were delicious and strong! We didn't need any appetizers; the soft pretzels with spicy stoe ground mustard were plenty to hold us over until our steaks arrived. I wasn't sure what to expect, but our filets (6 oz for me and 9oz for R) were awesome! They were ordered medium rare and cooked perfectly, and were accompanied by grilled asparagus spears and roasted fingerline potatoes. We also each ordered a sauce for our steaks: gorgonzola cream for me and steak au poivre for R. Everything was delicius, the atmosphere was relaxed and relatively quiet compared to most other places we've dined, and we enjoyed the rainy view over the highway and harbor. So delicious! We even had enough room left for a small dessert, so we shared a cheesecake with blueberry topping. It was unusual, baked in a round tart dish and topped with the blueberry sauce. Just a light bottom crust and no edge crust which was perfect for us. It was a great way to end a delicious meal and a great day!

The parking lot was beyond full when we left the restaurant (I still can't figure out where everyone would park if the restairant was anywhere near capacity) and someone was waiting for our spot. It was still rainign moderately as we made our way back to our room for the night.
