Last day in Tucson. Up early to do some laundry, then hike at Catalina State Park. By 8:30am the temperature was already well into the 80s. We decided on the "easy" hike to Romero Pools—easy according to the woman at the toll booth.  As you can tell by the quotes, it was not so easy. We felt whipped after a single mile of the 5.6 mile hike. The hike begins with a 1.1 mile trek along wide open sandy hot trails that are mercifully level, but then the steep and rocky climb begins. Rich was doing well from the start, but he was really feeling the heat today for some reason.  

By around 10:45 he felt he'd had enough and really needed to take a slow walk back to the car.  I was really torn about what to do. Nothing is as much fun as when I can share it with him, and at the same time I felt the need for a personal challenge. I was feeling strong today and not too bothered by the heat, so I decided to press on and see if I could reach the pools. Two men we had met on the way up had described the pools,  which sounded like a very neat and unusual desert attraction.  They also described the hike beyond the point at which we had stopped ... which sounded formidable. As the men had explained, there were two more sections of steep, rough switchbacks preceding a general leveling of the trail, then some rolling hills as I neared the pools. Once within a tenth of a mile, I could hear splashing and kids' voices. After a short descent toward the pools, I was greeted by the small, unimpressive pool the men had described. Just to the left, though, were the deeper pools where dozens of teenagers were spending the day plunging into the depths, climbing back up, and plunging again. This is quite an oasis in the sizzling, broiling heat of the desert!

The water was tempting but I wasn't planning on jumping in. Just getting to the pools (and back!) was my personal challenge for today. I sat on the rocky ledge adjacent to the one the teens were jumping from, rested, had a snack and another liter or so of water, and then began the hike back. After the first ascent, the hike was relatively easy (probably having had my little respite was a huge advantage, too). At this point, regardless of how I typically despise cell phone use on trails, I called Rich to report my location-thinking that by now he must be worried that it was taking so long. in fact, he was surprised that I had reached the pools already and was on my way back! After this point I knew it was fine to just take my time and enjoy the scenery again, while still being aware of the length of time I was exposed to the heat and sun. 

The downhill section through steep rocky crevices was tough, but those crevices also conveniently provide shade and gentle breezes that whistle through with merciful cooling. The toughest part was the last mile, which saw me rationing the little bit of water I had left and easing the sizzling of my skin by the shade of each acacia tree along the last mile, hopping from one to the next. And if you've seen a desert acacia tree, the shade they offer is laughable at best. For other easterners, think more "nearly dead maple tree in winter" than "grand old American elm." Once I could see the car, I knew I was home-free. Rich was strolling around the parking lot, his shirt off, still trying to cool off. It was just about 1:00pm. I downed an entire 32 oz. bottle of Gatorade in about 2 minutes and soon felt better. The air temperature was 104 degrees, which was only amplified by the sun and sand. R bought a hat (vortex hat?) in the visitors center here!

Our next stop was the Tanque Verde Greenhouses which had been closed on Monday when we first came by. I was drawn there by the "free cactus!" coupon in one of the local travel brochures. I mean, who can resist a free cactus— certainly not me! We could choose from any of the $0.85 cactuses. Many of them were really neat and beautiful but we chose a lobivia hybrid with 2 spent flowers and one bud because it appeared that it would be the easiest to transport home, including an opuntia subulata that looked rather too fragile for transport (but being an opuntia, it most likely would have been fine). The place was amazing-ablaze with rainbow of cactus flowers of all colors and huge cacti, very inexpensive for their size. There were "dinner plate" prickly pears and blue columnars that Rich liked (he always likes columnars!). As a cactophile, I truly can't say enough about this awesome place.  

Supper was at Lodge on the Desert, an old resort that has been continually updated. It was peaceful and quiet, and continuing the theme for today there are some massive cactus gardens surrounding the outdoor restaurant seating area. We started with a creamy artichoke spinach dip containing large pieces of both-which we prefer-served in a cast iron crock, and slices of crusty bread. With our meals also came regular bread served with olive oil infused with Meyer lemon, which was heavenly. We both had steak and cheddar & bacon potatoes in a small cast iron pot with an assortment of veggies: squash, carrots, and asparagus spears. The steak came with a spicy sauce, which we both enjoyed but felt wasn't entirely necessary, because the steak was so good on its own. We both had prickly pear mojitos (again with the cactus!). And our dessert, which we shared as we almost always do, was a salted banana pudding topped with caramelized bananas!
