For dad's first full day with us we chose something pretty laid back and restful that would also allow him to see a few of the spots we've been talking about. There were also showers in the area, so we didn't want to go too far or be up on high (slippery) rock ledges if the rain came down hard.

We were undecided about breakfast, but Dad was most interested in the Friar, so we took a stroll over there. The parking lot was nearly empty, which looked like a good sign, but when we got inside we found that the dining room was nearly full, with one table of 6 and two other tables of two. There wasn't any configuration that would allow for the three of us to sit together, so we decided to try somewhere else. We ended up at the bakery (2 Cats had also been an option, but some people passing by told us it was unexpectedly closed today). I guess everyone else had the same idea, because the bakery was packed with a line out the door when we arrived.  We ended up with a cheese bagel again, three sticky buns, a slice of orange cake, and two pieces of apple coffee cake for the trail. Wow! We were going to take our food back to our rooms and eat on the porch, but a table opened up before we left so we ate at he bakery instead. Everything was excellent.

Our plan was to get ourselves to the northern end of Eagle Lake either via the bike shuttle or the Southwest Harbor bus. Both were to leave the village green at 10:15 so we got there early to see what would work. We figured the SWH bus would be our better option because in the  past the bike shuttle has had to wait until the last minute and if it's full of bikes and bikers, they won't take hikers. But the man helping out at the green said it should be fine and he asked the shuttle driver, who was happy to take us to the lake (there were only two other people on board). So we actually got to Eagle Lake just after 10:00, probably 15-20 minutes earlier than we had expected to.

When we arrived at the lake it was windy as hell and there was still mist in the air. It was chilly in the spots where the wind blew clear across the lake. I think Dad was regretting not bringing a jacket. But that didn't last long - soon we were shielded from the lake and winds by vegetation and then forest. It was much warmer, and before long the sun even began to peek out.

About halfway down the eastern side of the lake, we detoured into the woods and down the faint path to the foundation arches. We've wanted to show it to dad for a few years now, since we found it, but we had never had the chance.  He loved it! Enjoyed walking among the various walls and supports and speculating about what might have happened here to cause the abandonment of the structure. We ate our trail snacks at the northernmost arch where Rich and I have rested and snacked before.

Back on the carriage road we continued south, again venturing into the woods at another faint path that would take us out to the old steamboat wharf area. Dad and I were looking at the round grass(?) growing there when Dad said - "Uh oh - " and pointed - "sundews!" I couldn't believe I had missed them! They were beautiful and were densely growing in one area of the shoreline here. Rich wandered off into the heavier boggy area while I was photographing the sundews, and he found even more, including some nice tiny specimens growing on a tree stump. The sun was peeking out again at this point and every once in a while the dewdrops would catch the light and sparkle.

We finished our walk by taking the carriage roads toward Bubble Pond, where we caught the Loop Road bus back to the visitors center, planning to go on to Sieur de Monts. We hadn't realized that the bus we were on was at the end of its service for the day so we had to get the next one, but it was only about a 10 minute wait and the bus was already there, so we just grabbed our front row seat and waited af ew minutes, then we were on to Sieur de Monts.

Dad really likes it here, as do we, so we were happy to spend a little more than an hour poking around here. Dad really enjoyed the museum and Rich and I spent time in the wild gardens. I gave a "dissertation" about local carnivorous plants to a group of "garden club" ladies from another area who weren't familiar with them. We watched numerous frogs on rocks and lilypads until we drew such a crowd that we couldn't stand it and had to leave. It was just about time to catch the bus by now anyway, but I had a few minutes to run into the nature center and purchase the biography of Dorr that I had noticed there earlier. (It was written by the Dorr historian whose articles I had read in Chebacco on Saturday in the library.) The bus came on time or maybe a minute or two early, and a few minutes later we were back in town.

While we were on the carriage roads at the intersection where the road continues straight toward Jordan Pond and eventually NEH, Dad asked if it was possible to go all the way to NEH. Of course it is, using carriage roads and the trails through Asticou, but it would take a while! This gave Rich the idea that we might take Dad down to the Asticou Inn for popovers! This worked out really well. We were late enough (it was almost 4:00 by the time we got back to te room, got the car and drove to NEH) that it served as our evening's dinner. We sat on the porch as usual, and it was beautiful although on this side of he island the sun and sudden warmth we had felt in town was nowhere to be found. At one point, a light rain began , but it was gentle and falling straight down so the large umbrellas over the tables were more than sufficient to keep us completely dry. (Not so much the waiter with spiked hair and lots of "product" who was darting between the umbrellas to keep his coiffure dry, and covering it with his hand when he had to emerge into the open. It was beyond amusing.) We started with popovers, really good as always, strawberry jam and we tried wild blueberry jam too - maybe not traditional but it sure was good! Then rich and I shared a seafood dip with tortilla chips. Dad had the maple glazed chicken sandwich and a green salad, I had the curry chicken salad n a croissant, and Rich had the special shrimp tacos with pineapple, cilantro and avocado. Everything was o tasty and fun to enjoy outside. We also had beers - I had the Viper IPA I enjoyed on Monday and R and Dad had the Peeper ale. Great all around! Dad explored the inn after eating and we found that they have 48 rooms in all, including the cottages nearby and what we were calling "pods" (The guy at the desk called them topsiders.) Early night in for relaxing!
