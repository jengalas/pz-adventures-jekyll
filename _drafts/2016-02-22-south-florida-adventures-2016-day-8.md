Breakfast of course was at Bob's bunz! W decided to eat first and then come back to the room because we still needed to check in but the office wasn't open until 9. Our breakfast was an Apple blossom for each of us plus a mini sticky bun for me and a croissant for R. Which he eventually got toasted (Be sure to tell them you want to eat there! :O).

After checking in we asked Mike if he knew anything about the tree cactus preserve. He didn't but recommended that we check at the visitors center, where were going anyway. Based on previous experience with visitors centers in general, I had a feeling that we'd know more about the preserve than the people there did, which was true. The first man we talked to had no clue. The older woman seemed to at least be aware of it. Ask she had to offer was "pull over by the picnic tables across from the Green Turtle." We had no idea what she was talking about but decided to check it out. We ended up finding yet another small preserve, the Green Turtle Hammock Preserve. There's an abandoned house in the  back, and we had to wonder what happened there. Quite sad. There was a small pond and some new nature trails cut through the hammock, with palms and cactus and a really cool large spider in his web. Every once in a while when, I assume, he detected movement in his web he would scuttle down, grab the treat, and then do a backflip top land back in the center of the web.

We left the car at the turtle preserve, because it didn't appear that there was anywhere to park at the cactus preserve, and we walked down toward the cactus preserve. Unfortunately it didn't look any more accessible than it did on the street view. The gate was closed and overgrown and wet couldn't find any way to get inside, despite the new-looking sign. It looked like no one had been there in a decade. The only sign of life were the "notice of public hearing" posters around the perimeter, something do with requesting a variance from the town council. A disappointment, but we weren't really expecting much anyway. We even checked the adjacent marina but that too was deserted.

We were hungry for some much so we decided to try the Tower of Pizza, just for something to compare to last night's pizza. It wasn't bad. The crust was a bit drier and breadier, the sauce was more flavorful since it had oregano and other spices already included. Cheese was fair.

Successfully refueled we next went to try to find the Layton Trail, part of the Long Key State Park that we didn't think we had hiked before.Wet couldn't quite remember, all I remember was that last time we drive back and forth 3-4 times trying to find the trailhead which is buried in the trees and not really marked. As soon as we found it we both realized we had never hiked it. The trail starts of wide and kinda spooky-dark, and you can see straight through to the bay. So cool! There are two little side trails that form a loop. Along the way we found so many things to photograph, from many cactus (all acanthocereus) in different stages of growth to coconuts, thatch palms, brilliant yellow green algae, spongy soft mat right at the shore. We spent probably an hour on this short trail and loved it.

Without enough time to do the other part of Long Key we decided to check two more fishing piers for bms. We found several more along with their lizard guardians! :-)

Supper tonight was at the Old Tavernier which we really enjoyed last time. We started with two local beers and a broccoli bisque that was ok but we didn't care too much for it. then a great baked mushroom dish.The mushrooms were stuffed with crabmeat and laced with a white sauce and then baked under a thin layer of cheese. The best was yet to come, though. We shared a whole yellowtail cooked Greek style, dressed with lemon and olive oil. It was one of the best things we've had, and in the top 2 best fish I've ever had! The skin was crispy and rat and the seasoning went all though the fish. The fish was incredibly moist. We picked every bit off the bones. We took a good piece of key lime pie (nice and tart, very thin crust!) home for dessert, which we shared along with some shiraz.
