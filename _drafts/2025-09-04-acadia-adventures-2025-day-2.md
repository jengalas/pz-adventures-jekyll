We had a decently long rest for once, and didn't get on the road this morning until after 7:00am. It was already shaping up to be a mild and very sunny day. I'd had a note on my calendar that I made last year suggesting that we try taking Route 1 up the coast rather than the usual Interstate to Routes 3 and 1, and with plenty of time to spare before check-in time, we decided to go for it.

Can't avoid at least some Interstate driving, but it was a relatively easy 35-or-so minute drive along I-95 and I-295 from the rest area to Exit 24 just past Freeport, where we turned left onto Route 1. We began following the route all through the small (and medium-sized) towns. It was our first trip over the graceful Sagadahoc Bridge in Bath, and our first time in Wiscasset, home of the famous lobster shack Reds Eats. (Too bad that it doesn't open until 11:30am.) Just across Route 1 and down on the pier is Sprague's Lobster, not nearly as well known, but we had heard about it from a chance conversation with a man at the Bucking Lobster food truck last year, who recommended Sprague's. They had a neat setup with several little buildings surrounding the lobster shack itself, such as a pottery shed, a little booth selling jams and jellies, and some historical exhibits. It was like a more authentic version of the "cruise ship Disney pier town" that is set up in Bar Harbor now. One of the funniest things was a series of wooden figures, two depicting a sailor and a lobsterman (typical) but the third was a carving of a lobster wearing a bib and holding the decapitated head of a man (presumably a lobsterman), ready to chow down. You really had to look closely to see what it was, though, and I'm sure many people bypass it entirely. I love subtle visual comedy artifacts like that.

As you may have expected, I took a quick look at my application that allows me to plat nearby NGS benchmarks on a map, so I had one in mind as we walked back to our parking spot in a small public lot along Water Street. The benchmark in question was just two blocks down Water Street, at its intersection with Fore Street. 

When we reached the building (which had housed a post office as mentioned in the benchmark description, but was more commonly known as the Customs House) we spotted the benchmark immediately from the opposite side of Water Street. But my heart sank when I saw the sign indicating it was a private residence and the two entrances from the sidewalk level were roped off.

There were four people sitting at a picnic table in front of the building, however, working on something. We debated whether to approach them and Rich decided just to go underneath the "barrier," such as it was, and ask the people if we could recover the mark. Not only did they not even flinch when we came onto the property, but the man we spoke with was very interested in the mark, how benchmarks are used, and what we mean by "recovering" it. He was so interested that we even heard him telling the other people at the table about it, excitedly, when he returned to them. He provided contact information that I can use for the official recovery, and we were surprised to learn that the man moved here from Lackawaxen (although originally from New York). 

Property records show that it is owned by Customs House LLC with an address in Lackawaxen, so I can only assume that maybe they are planning to renovate the building (although it already appeared to be in good condition) - maybe open it to the public or use it for some commercial purpose? It would be interesting to find out.

Rich asked if there were any other benchmarks nearby. The only ones I could see that might be within walking distance were two church spires, which are generally not that exciting from a recovery standpoint because NGS No longer uses them, but they are often interesting from a historical standpoint. One was a white spire on a congregational church, and the other was a (formerly) brown spire - now also white - on an old Episcopal church dating to at least 1857.

Getting hungry now, we headed out of town on Route 1 toward our next stop, which was to be Belfast, so we could get some distances and bearings in order to get T 18, the marker we found last year, entered into the NGS database. The only trouble along the way was the most bizarre stretch of roadwork I've seen in a while (since a few years ago, also along Route 1 in Maine) just past Camden. Not only was the road down to one lane with an insanely long (~10 minute) backup, but both lanes were scraped down to the dirt. So even when you finally had the chance to drive on the single lane/shoulder (whichever was available) you were just driving on pure dirt. Even in PA, they will pave one lane at a time so at least you have a reasonable driving surface.

Once we got to Belfast, we had no trouble parking at the small lot near the footbridge and locating the mark again. As Rich said, you can't miss it, so he really doesn't see why they need these reference distances! Nevertheless, we used a combination of his rangefinder and my laser measuring tool to gather four references, even though they don't seem all that useful. We measured to the corner of the nearby building, to the side of the bridge bannister, to the nearest bridge pier, and to a utility box. 

We didn't linger long here after taking those measurements. We were very hungry by now! Just a quick drive across the highway bridge took us to Young's Lobster Pound, which is apparently much busier around noon than it is at 9:00am (understandably). Even though it was busy, it didn't take too long for our lobster rolls to be prepared, and we were more than ready for them.

It was much too windy to sit outside to eat, so even though it was a beautiful day otherwise, we opted to sit indoors. It wasn't too busy inside, and the tables are far enough apart that no one really bothered us. The lobster rolls were *full* of lobster as always, incredibly delicious and fresh. We tried to make them last and really savor every bite, but we were hungry and they were so good ... they didn't last long. With kettle chips and pickle slices on the side, and blackberry mango seltzer water, it all made for a perfect lunch.

It was finally time to head to our ultimate destination in Bar Harbor. The trip of about an hour and a half, maybe a bit less, took us through some of our old favorite areas like Searsport (just past Moose Point State Park!), Verona Island and Bucksport, and Ellsworth. It was nearly 2:30 by the time we arrived, parked, and checked in. Everything here looks pretty much the same, except we don't seem to have any heat coming from our AC unit. And we're going to need some heat on these chilly nights! 

After bringing all of our luggage and other items in from the car, we cleaned up and rested for a little while (I had to set a 20 minute timer!) and we headed down to Rosalie's Pizza just a bit after 4:00pm. We weren't part of the 3:45-line-at-the-door crowd today! But we were close, and the second floor was still almost empty. I took one of the end tables near the window while Rich ordered our House Veggie medium pizza and two large Allagash White ales. The first bite and the first sip were heavenly! As were all of the remaining bites and sips. We lingered over the treats for as long as we could, talking about possible running routes in the park. And then when it was all over (or, rather, when we were too stuffed to continue and put the remaining two pieces in a takeout box) we took a slow walk back toward the hotel. I stopped for some paper products (MEGA XL paper towels, anyone? 8-inch diameter?!) while Rich continued back to the room. After I returned, Rich went over to the hotel office to ask if the AC unit could be fixed or replaced. Then I took a shower and we collapsed in bed. I worked on benchmark and notes while Rich dozed. I discovered two survey stations that we missed in Wiscasset: triangulation station WISCASSET and the really cool one, a powder magazine very close to the triangulation station, built in 1813, that served as a landmark station.
