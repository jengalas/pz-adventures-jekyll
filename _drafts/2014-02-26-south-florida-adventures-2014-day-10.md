Everglades very good, saw huge barred owl yesterday. Looks like still  more brutal cold when we get home. No [boat ride in the Everglades], lots of hiking and poking around instead.Temp well above average here! Sun very hot but still much better than being cold.
We are going back this morning to see more alligators.
