This morning Rich was suffering with more pressure in his ears, an affliction that has been getting worse over the past few days. He decided to see if we could find an urgent care facility where a doctor might be able to clean out his ears or at least give us some idea what the problem was and how to treat it.

The only urgent care office anywhere remotely nearby is in Ellsworth, and it had really horrible online reviews, both factors which gave us pause. Then I happened to notice a very small family medicine practice right here in town, so we thought it might be worth checking it out to see if we could at least get an apointment within the next day or so.

The medical office apparently shares a building with a dental practice. We asked the receptionist if we could possibly get an appointment, but she sets up appointments for the dental office only and asked that we phone the medical office, so I did. We called while in the building just in case we could be seen quickly, but it turned out that the next available appointment wasn't until Wednesday at 10:00am. We'll take it, and see what happens. In the meantime, they were going to send Rich some forms to fill out ahead of time.

This gave us the rest of the day to poke around, assuming Rich was feeling up to it. He generally feels better when he's doing something (don't we all) so he was game to check out a benchmark we've had our eye on for a few days: K 15 along Kelleytown Road in Tremont. I don't know why we had never searched for this mark before; I'm sure I had noticed it on the USGS datasheets, but I guess we just never got around to actually researching and looking for it. But when I recently checked the Google satellite view, I saw an obvious large boulder very close to where the coordinates should be, based on the topo map. Too good to be true? (Spoiler: yes) Seemed likely, especially since the boulder was about 20 farther away from the road than the description specified. But still worth investigating. Even if the boulder we could see on the satellite view wasn't the correct one, there certainly might be another one nearby that was.

Our first stop was at the Paradis hardware store down the road, to pick up a trowel, small brush, and some paper towels. It was a really good decision because we needed to use those tools later on.

Kelleytown Road was pretty remote, as I had suspected, and we found easy roadside parking right near the location of the mark. Right from the road, we spotted a smaller (but still prominent) boulder that appeared to be just about the correct distance from the road, and we thought for sure that would be the one. But looking underneath the thick voer of moss we could see the entire surface of the boulder, and there was no mark on it.

Just for good measure we also checked the huge boulder we'd seen on the satellite and street views, but it was immediately clear that it probably wasn't the right one. It didn't appear exceptionally stable, and there were cracks and fissures in the boulder that made it an unlikely choice for a permanent setting.

We spent at least another 30 minutes in the area, measuring from the road and checking every boulder, no matter the size, that we could find. It's too bad there weren't any other useful references in the description; the only other reference was to a house that was deserted when the mark was set in 1934, and it's apparently completely gone now. Other than two deep pits that may have been cellars, I didn't notice any evidence of human habitation there (no stacked stones, no bottles or cans). The description didn't even specify the size of the boulder. Without much to go on, we decided to move on.

The next mark for today was J 145, which had eluded me when I searched for it several years ago. This time, with two recent recoveries and a meticulous description from surveyor JRO (plus a personal pep talk via email ensuring me that it wasn't hard to find) I set off into the woods at the intersection of Tremont Road and Seal Cove Road.

Well ... the ledges all seemed to be covered over with a thick layer of soil and roots. How could it have changed so much in the three years since the mark was last recovered? I naively thought I would be led right to the mark by the witness sign that JRO had placed, as has happened with other nearby marks, but there was simply no evidence of it anywhere. Even if the sign was gone, I figured that the fencepost would still be around somewhere, but it wasn't. It took some good use of the rangefinder combined with JRO's reference points and some old-time benchmark hunting intuition to zero in on the correct ledge, but even then I was unsure. The first tentative swipes with my hand showed that there was at least 3-4 inches of soil and fine root buildup on the top surface of the ledge. Rich retrieved the trowel and brush from the car, and I began scraping the rock. I was just about to give up when I spotted the nice round edge of the mark! I could hardly believe it. It was so well hidden and also so well camouflaged, that even when I knew exactly where it was, when I took my photos from a distance, it was hard to spot.

I didn't have any way to replace the witness sign, but I had some pink flagging tape, so I attached that to the tree nearest to the mark (there was only one and it was very small, so it had to do), and another larger tree that was clearly visible from the road. They should be good enough to lead someone to the mark for another year or so. It will be interesting to check on it next time and see if the flagging tape is still there, and if the mark has gotten covered over again.

We were hungry by this time and it was nearly 1:00pm, so it was past time to head to the Northeast Harbor marina for some goodies from the Bucking Lobster food truck. We both got their new menu item, lobster bahn mi roll, and it was so good! Heavy on the lobster as usual, with a spicy mayo and pickled carrots and cucumbers on top. We got one with fries and one with chips, and ate at one of the picnic tables. Perfect lunch!

Afterward, we spent some time in the room resting and relaxing. We went back and forth about what to do for dinner. We really just wanted something light, so the new Mexican place (Salsa Verde Grill) and the new Mediterranean/Turkish place (Limon Grille) both sounded like good options. There was some inconsistent information online about whether Salsa Verde Grill was actually open on Mondays, so we opted for Limon. It was an excellent choice! We ordered online, which was quick and easy, and I took a walk down to pick up the food at the little building that housed the Slice of Eden Bakery years ago, Salsa Verde Grill last year, and now Limon. The first thing I noticed when I stepped inside was the delicious aroma. The place smelled amazing, grilled meats and spices and citrus. I had to wait a few minutes for my order to be completed, in which time the restaurant started to fill up. In addition to the two couples already seated when I arrived, two more came in while I waited, and a few other people picked up online takeout orders. The guys working there (the two brothers who own the place, I assume) were extremely friendly and helpful, and really seemed to enjoy their work.

When I arrived back at the room with the food, Rich was just finishing up the medical form. We got things set up to eat and watch a video at the same time, which was admittedly a bit tricky. The food was all delicious! We started with the doner sandwich, which we got with a mix of beef and chicken. It was topped with tomatoes, lettuce, and onions and had an unusual and intriguing sauce, not at all similar to tzaziki but with a warm spice flavor, almost reminiscent of curry. Then we shared an order of grilled chicken skewers. This was a large platter of pita, a solid helping of grilled chicken pieces, salad, and rice. All excellent. We shared an IPA and later each had a sip of wine for "dessert."

We watched a few more videos, and then I spent some more time researching benchmarks in the area!
