Today's breakfast was goig to be a lighter one again. Mount Dessert Bakery was supposed to be open, so we decided to pick up some treats there and head back to eat on our porch. We were surprised to see no activity around the bakery, and thought it might be closed again, but were happy to see that it was open. We got two wild blueberry hand pies to snack on later as well as a croissant. Rich also got an egg, cheese, and ham sanwich on a croissant and I got a plain bagel with veggie cream cheese. We ate on our porch as planned. It was a mostly cloudy morning, and pleasantly warm but not hot.

We went back and forth a few times trying to decide what we should do today. Thinking it would stay cloudy and not too warm, we decided to try hiking Cadillac North Ridge to see how far we could get. It was a quick trip on the bus from the village green to the North Ridge trailhead stop. We got off and headed onto the trail.

The first part of the trail that begins here at Pardise Hill Rd. (jst before it becomes the Park loop Road) is actually a short section of the Kebo Brook Trail that heads east toward the "true" trailhead for Cadillac North Ridge, which is on the Park Loop road. We got a little mixed up because there was some trail construction going on and no signage to lead us to the steps from KEbo Brook up to the Park Loop Road (keep in mind I've never hiked this trail and Rich hasn't done it in decades). We actually saw the set of steps we were supposed to take, but they appeared to be roped off (they weren't; that's just how they looked from the angle of the trail below) and all signage kept pointing us east along Kebo Brook. It wasn't long before I suspected that something wasn't right, and Rich was feeling the same way. We turned arund and ran into another couple who had done the same thing, and then a family. The family turned around and folowed up back to the construction area, where I asked one of the trail crew how to get up to the North Ridge trail. She explained where we had to go. It worked out fine, just made no sense because there was no signage for that particular turn, and as I mentioned, it looked from below like the steps to the Park Loops Road were blocked off.  

Once we began hiking on the correct trail it felt like a summit trail from the beginning - rocky and steep. It had turned into a sunny and extremely humid day, and we were feeling it frm the beginning. On an open ledge we stopped to take a breath and enjoy the view, and I looked down and at my feet, saw another snake! He just popped right out in front of me again. This was a small red-bellied snake like the one we saw last year on the carriage roads. We took some photos. He was quite active and alert, and even got into a striking pose at one poitn (kinda funny and cute to see this tiny little snake who thuoght he was a big tough rattler). Of course, as usual people had to horn in on our photo -taking session. The little snake kep slipping off the smooth granite, which was also very cute to watch (and hopefully not too stressful for him). 

We continued on quite a distance, but were still almost a mile from the summit when Rich decided that we had better turn around and try again another day. It was just too hot and humid. We were at one of the points very close to the road, so I went ahead and found a spot where we could easily get up to the road. We dfigured walking down the road woudl be a better plan than trying to walk back down the trail. 

We soon came to an overlook along the road and found an even better, more obvious trail there that leads to the oNorth Rdge trail. I marked this point as a bailout point (or a point to easily join the trail from the road, if that was desired). It's .67 miles from this point to the bottom of the hill and the intersection with the Park Loop Road, just for future refernece.

We also checked _Pathmakers_ tonight and found out that the trail originally crossed the road near that bailout point, and was rerouted in the 1930s or 40s to eliminate the road crossing. And frm _Pathmakers_ also, it looks like there was once a spur trail to a small peak called the Whitecap, but I don't see any further reference in _pathmakers_ to that.

We finihsed our walk down the road (whcih was easy walking and shaded, the only problem being the traffic that was flying by). Had no trouble flagging down a Park Loop bus which took us back to the visitors center, and from there we eventually got a bus back to the village green. (It took a while because we happened to arrive there during the bus drivers' lunchtime. I thought i had 20 minutes so I went into the visitors center and bought another copy of A Walk in the Park, while apparently a "sweeper" bus came by to take some people to the village green. Oops. Well, at least the scheduled bus was there on time, and we took it.)

We were originally thinking about McKays or Side Street Cafe for supper, but when we walked by Side Street we saw a sign stating that they were closed today for some kind of a staff function. We were giving more consideration to McKays when we approached the Black Friar and I suggested that we try that instead. Rich was game for it. So we came back to the room (it was still pretty early) and had a snack and somem water outside on the porch, and then rested for a while before supper. We walked down to the Friar for 5:00 (actually arrived a little early) and were seated at our favorite table for two. We started with two beers (Marsh Island Brewing's Deep Dive IPA, and Fogtown ??) and Welsh rarebit. Then I had the fish tacos on corn tortillas with a small salad (blue cheese dressing) and Rich had a burger with a "thick" (actually thin) slice of onion and yellow American cheese, and fries with no salt. (The fries are pretty good - unlike most places they aren't batter-dipped or coated in any way.)  While we ate we talked about the Island Explorer buses and how it seems like it would be a good idea to have a few hike/bike shuttles between the Village Green and the visitors center and EAgle Lake (and maybe Sieur de Monts as well). We wondered how they decided on the routes that exist and what the reasons were behind the decisions. We also considered some ways to hike up the Green & White path to the Bowl, and then take the Champlain South Ridge trail to Champlain Summit. From there would it be better to take the North Ridge trail (formerly Bear Brook) down to the Park Loop, or go back the way we had come? Beachcroft is another possibility but it's much longer and not as easy to get a bus at the end. 

Rich proposed ice cream for dessert, so we walked over to MDI Ice Cream and ended up with two kiddie-size cones (Callebaut chocolate for R, and London Fog [Earl Grey flavor] for me). They were both very good!
