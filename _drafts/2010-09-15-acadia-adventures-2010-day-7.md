Breakfast: Jeannie's: strawberry pancakes, cranberry juice; veggie eggs Benedict, coffee (R) with oat toast
Supper: Burning Tree: white hen clam pasta to share, Ida's crab cakes as always (with Puff Crabby!); spicy Indian halibut with yogurt raita; raspberry semifreddo with blueberries.

Breakfast-food good but service disappointing.  We found out that Jeannie retired and sold the business this year.  Ride at Parkman Mountain (18-13-12-10-11-13-18). Hilly but excellent ride, not too many people.  Warm when sunny and calm (and when climbing hills) but cold otherwise. Then went to check out the Long Pond fire road.  Rode just over three miles to check it out.  Very nice, hilly, almost no one on the road.  Comes down to meet Long Pond at one point which is very nice. Past this point, we also found a nice little pond accessed by a short road off to the right of the fire road.  On the way back, we stopped when we saw a witness post and found K 17 (PE0321) which for some reason we hadn't looked for before.
