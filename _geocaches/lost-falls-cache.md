  Hi!


  Well, I tried to go three for three with the Johnsons06 Susquehanna County caches, but I came up short (actually, I came up wet, filthy, and a little sore—yes, this area is a real treat after it rains!). I had a great deal of trouble with satellite reception; I did manage to get to the coordinates, according to my GPSr, five times—but in five very different locations. It was very dark and that made it extra difficult to search. I don't think I looked for more than half an hour before getting frustrated and deciding to come back another day. I'm glad I got to see the falls, though. They are beautiful, especially after the rain we've had. On my way back to the car, I surprised a doe and a noisy grouse. I'll be back...
