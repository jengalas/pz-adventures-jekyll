  Hi, Dr. Redfield (that is your name this week, right?)!


  Rich and I looked at this puzzle on and off for a week or two, testing a few ideas that didn’t work out, before we finally stumbled upon the solution. It was confirmed by the solution checker. We’ll be adding this one to our growing Middletown Geocaching to-do list! Thanks for the puzzle; we enjoyed it, as always!
  

  Zhanna and ~Rich in NEPA~
