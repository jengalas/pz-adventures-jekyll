  Hi ZC!


  Our fabulous morning consisted of a first find on a new cache, two benchmark hunts, and a very nutritious lunch of lemon Tastykake pie, Ghirardelli filled chocolate squares, and Fun Size Butterfingers. Your cache was a fitting start to an equally fun afternoon! We had a good idea what kind of place we were looking for, and as we neared the site our suspicions were confirmed. Your coordinates didn’t lead us directly to the cache, but Rich took a wander around and spotted the cache within a few minutes. It took me a little longer, but eventually I came across its hiding spot too. We took our treasure to a nearby table, and while Rich explored the local offerings I signed the log and made my trade. I took a transparent ladybug—fitting because I’ve seen more than my share of ladybugs today, for whatever reason. Into the container I stuffed one of my fluorescent rats (try them under blacklight!). Thanks for the welcome! :grin:

  Howdy, ZC! This was the second “First Find” in a fun-filled day of caching and benchmark hunting. It started early this morning around 8:10AM when Zhanna picked me up on the way to the Tarkill Interpretive Trail cache. From there we hunted for two nearby benchmarks then headed over to Milford to see if our suspicions about where this cache was located were accurate. We arrived just before noontime and spent a few minutes searching in the area where the posted coordinates lead us, found nothing and decided to expand the search pattern. Found the cache quickly but it was about 27 feet to the southeast. Both of our GPS receivers indicated a similar discrepancy so future cachers may want to keep this in mind. I signed the logbook, took nothing, and left an Irish coin. We also availed ourselves of some of the local hospitality. Thanks for an interesting geocaching experience. ~Rich in NEPA~
