  Howdy, Gilwell1!


  Zhanna and I were at it again today, attempting to solve another one of your devious puzzle geocaches. This time we scratched our heads for only a few minutes before Zhanna hit on an idea. So we gave it a shot and … bingo! … we got the answer. The Solution Checker agreed. As is the case for your other puzzle geocaches in this area, we probably won’t be visiting them anytime soon. We are adding it to our geocaching to-do list, just in case we have a chance to stop by and “roam” around looking for these caches. Thanks for yet another formidable puzzle challenge!
