  Hi, DJGecko!


  This was the second cache on our mini-tour of Central Park this sunny September Saturday. The coordinates took us right to an area we definitely didn't want to search through, but just a few minutes later we discovered the cache in a much friendlier place very close by. I retrieved it quickly while a woman slumbered only three feet away. We had nothing small enough to leave, so we traded nothing this time. I signed the log, but more space is definitely needed. Love the cache name! Thanks for a cool adventure.
