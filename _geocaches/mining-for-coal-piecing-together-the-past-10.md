  Hi STEARanger!


  Rich in NEPA and I were out and about this morning and decided to head to McDade Park to continue collecting pieces for our puzzle. “Mining for Coal” was our first find today. Nice hiding spot and interesting piece of equipment! We signed the logbook, took our puzzle piece, hung around to take a few photos, and then headed up the hill toward “Anthracite!”. Thanks for another fun hunt. I’m so glad Rich was able to come along this time!

  Howdy, STEARanger!


  I wasn’t planning to search for this series at all. Geocaching just doesn’t hold the same appeal for me as it once did, so I haven’t logged any new caches in a very long time. My always-amazingly-awesome wife, Zhanna, however, decided to take on the challenge of collecting all twelve of the puzzle pieces, so this morning I thought I’d go along with her to McDade Park and the Anthracite Museum in order to find pieces ten and eleven. The weather was pleasant and it turned out to be a fun little adventure. I signed the log, took nothing (except a few photos!), and left nothing. Thanks for creating this historically informative series of geocaches.
