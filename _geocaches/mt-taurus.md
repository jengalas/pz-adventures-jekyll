  Hi again, EFB!


  This was the second and final geocache of the day for Aaron, Rich and me. As we’ve done several times throughout this Summer and Fall, we spent the day in the Hudson Highland region, exploring and climbing to rocky overlooks with incredible views along the river. After locating your Bull Hill Junction cache, we followed the white trail toward the summit of Bull Hill, stopping here and there for views of Breakneck Ridge, the Shawangunks and the Catskills beyond (which unfortunately were obscured by haze). My companions were prepared for a short rest period (or a few minutes of boredom) while I recovered the NGS tri-station BULL HILL RESET. Rich aided in the recovery while Aaron fended off questions from overly curious kids passing by.


  Approaching the most scenic and most popular overlook, where we’d planned to nap for a while and share a picnic lunch, we heard (and then saw) several girls already on the rocks. Luckily we were in a good position to take our time, find the cache first, and then enjoy our break with the hope that we’d have some solitude by the time we reached the ledge. The cache was easy to find, if a little slippery to get to, and everything inside was dry and in good condition. Neat, unique container! Rich left some of his special signature geo-magnets, and I took the cat stickers.


  We enjoyed our lunch of pizza, cheese sandwiches, fresh roasted pumpkin seeds and other assorted snacks on the rocks, and then attempted to take a short nap in the sunshine. Soon, though, the peace was broken by advancing hordes of teenagers and young adults who insisted on bringing the city to the mountain. Why is it so hard to leave your cell phone turned off for an afternoon?! Outnumbered, we soon left in search of quiet ledges further on down the trail, which we did find. By this time, though it was getting later in the afternoon and we wanted to avoid coming out of the woods in the dark. Our plan was to take the yellow-blazed (poorly blazed, as we found out) Undercliff Trail to the Nelsonville Trail, then follow this over the path of the Catskill Aqueduct to the Split Rock trail. I had a great time playing at the rock, climbing all over it and pointing out its interesting natural features as well (“Hey! Is that the Virgin Mary?!”). Worn out and ready to eat, we soon headed back down the short section of the Lone Star trail toward the car and then to Cold Spring for a well deserved dinner of ravioli, fish stew, and braised short ribs at The Riverside.


  I’m afraid this may have been our last Hudson Highlands day trip for this year, but we’ve only just started exploring the many fascinating historical and geological areas in this region. We’ll be back many times in the future. Thanks for the introduction to Bull Hill!

  Howdy, EFB!


  Continuing our climb to Bull Hill summit from your Bull Hill Junction cache, we made sure to stop and spend sufficient time at each of the overlooks. The views were fabulous despite a thick haze on the distant horizons.


  Upon reaching survey tri-station BULL HILL RESET, Zhanna, our resident Queen of Benchmarks, did a full recovery of the station and will shortly be submitting an official report to her contacts at NGS. As a side note, since the station mark itself is missing, there’s a likely chance that NGS will reclassify the station as either “destroyed” or in “poor condition.” Such a shame that some people have to be so thoughtless and uncaring about these priceless and historic National treasures!


  Our next goal was to search for the cache. Once again it was an easy find. Didn’t need the hints. And by the way, that’s quite an unusual container, but it seems to work well! We found it appropriately hidden; its contents in good shape. I left two of my signature geo-magnets, took nothing, and signed the logbook.


  From the cache site it was a short scramble to a large outcropping ledge with a gorgeous view to the south. This is where we decided to have our picnic lunch and take a quiet little nap while laying in the warm sunshine. However, it quickly became apparent that this spot is very popular: a lot like Grand Central Station, I’d say!!! It was bustling and noisy today. We hung out there for about an hour or more, then figured we’d better keep a close eye on the time needed to complete the loop back to our car.


  We continued following the Washburn trail west to it’s intersection with the Nelsonville trail. For the most part, the Nelsonville trail is rather poorly blazed, and keeping to the trail took considerable concentration and sharp eyes. The thick layer of fallen leaves only obscured whatever worn pathway there may have been. Aaron, our Indian tracker/guide, was of great assistance here! Once we reached the woods road section, things got easier again. It was already getting late in the day. Zhanna had the printout for the Undercliff cache, but once we realized that it was a multi-stage affair, we decided to pass on it for another trip. At Split Rock we played around for a while, taking photos and doing a little casual “bouldering,” totally unaware that there was yet another cache within spitting distance! Oh, well … we’ll get it next time too. We finally returned to the car with only a little daylight left to spare.


  Of course, no day-trip of ours would be complete without a stop for dinner at a good restaurant. After all, the only reason we hike at all is for the food, right?! The nearby town of Cold Spring seemed to be attractive and touristy enough to have its fair share of nice places to eat. We chose a little restaurant/bar called The Riverside which, as its name suggests, is very close to the Hudson. Hence it was a very fitting end to a very memorable day!
