  Hi, J & L!


  We finally decided to take a trip to this neck of the woods and try some caching down here. We had a lovely day for the drive! The sun was bright and warm, which almost made up for the extremely strong, cold wind. We found all four parts with ease as your coordinates were right on (it didn't hurt that we got all the answers correct, either ðŸ˜‰). We really enjoy this kind of challenge! Everything was in good condition except for container #2, which unfortunately was very wet inside. The clue can still be read, but the ink is running and I fear it may not be legible much longer. The cache itself was very nicely concealed and in a nice location (if you avoid the thorns). We left a Lego set and took the Art Vandelay space shuttle travel bug. Thanks for a fine walk and a fun challenge on a bright and blustery day!


  Zhanna and Aaron
