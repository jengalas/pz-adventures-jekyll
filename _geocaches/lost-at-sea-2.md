  Hi, GeeOh!


  _(Continued from my See Sandy Run cache log …)_


  Well, on the long slow drive to the vast sea of stones, the sprinkles began again, and the rain soon followed. By the time we reached the parking area the rain was steady, though still light. After a fruitless search for a possible trail around the boulders, we headed straight across, first testing the rocks, which surprisingly weren’t slippery at all. Rich’s excellent memory (and his GPSr) led us right to the spot. The Indian guard is nowhere to be found, but the cache is still in place. It’s wet inside, though, and the logbook is soaked through! Rich made a short note of our visit, being careful not to get the book any wetter; unfortunately because of the conditions we weren’t able to dry out the contents at all and had to put everything back in the musty container wet as it was.


  We swiftly skedaddled our way in heavier rain back to the parking area, where we briefly considered and then quickly discarded the idea of going for the Earthcache at this location. It was cold and we were wet and hungry. (I was particularly jealous of the two couples sharing a bottle of wine in the back of their SUV!)


  From the list of nearby dining establishments in Rich’s iQue, we identified “Franco’s Pizzeria” in White Haven as a candidate for lunch. When we arrived we discovered that it is now called “Pancho’s Pizzeria” and is a combination pizzeria and Mexican restaurant. It’s bizarre, but it seems to work! The sausage pizza tasted great and had a nice thin crispy crust. I can’t vouch for the Mexican fare since we didn’t try it, but I have a feeling it would be quite authentic. We stopped at Bear Creek Falls along White Haven Road on our way home, and took a few photos … very quickly because it was raining and I was frozen. We still haven’t searched for the cache at that location.


  It’s been over three years since my first visit to “Lost at sea?” and I enjoyed this experience just as much, even in the less-than-perfect weather conditions. I hope you’re able to maintain this cache for years to come!
