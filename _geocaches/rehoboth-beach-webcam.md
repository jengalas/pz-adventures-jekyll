  Hi, LRs!


  This was an unexpected challenge. Believe it or not, it took us (with Rich in NEPA on the phone) quite a long time to “locate” this cache. It was growing dark when we started, and we had some trouble figuring out the best place to stand. By the time we got a photo that was at all acceptable, it was dark. Thanks—we had a great time with this one! (I haven't seen my cell phone bill yet, though. 🙂)


  Zhanna and Aaron


  PS Thanks also to Rich for being so patient. 🙂
