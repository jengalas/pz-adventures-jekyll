  Hi, gpsfun!


  Thanks for the tour! I've been in Rehoboth many times, but I've never toured the town in quite this fashion. We took our time walking to all the sites on this hazy, humid day. I didn't purchase anything to eat at the suggested spot today, though I did last night while completing another cache in the area. The “enterprise” is so neat! Completing this cache was a great way to spend a relaxed vacation morning.


  Zhanna and Aaron
