  Hi again, ZC!


  Continuing on up the road from Where Are You From Heading East, we soon arrived at the lovely little rest area near Middletown, NY. In addition to the typical facilities for the weary traveler, this rest stop also offers a well maintained park with plenty of trees and grass, and picnic tables placed here and there. We had no trouble with satellite reception even beneath the trees, so I almost expected we'd walk right up to this cache like we did with the last. Hmm, I thought after a few minutes of poking around. There's nothing obvious here, other than a certain grouping of objects that appeared might have concealed a micro cache at one time. I checked every logical spot I saw, as well as some not-so-logical spots. There was nothing to be found‚Äîat least not by us. Eventually breaking down and decrypting the hint didn't help much either. The spot we'd considered most likely to have concealed the cache fit the description in the hint, but it wasn't necessarily the _only_ such spot. With many adventures ahead of us (and miles to go before we could sleep!) we decided to simply move on. Rich agreed to inform you by e-mail and send photos so that we'll at least know our mistake, if we made one. I do hope that the cache is still in place and that we just overlooked it. Thanks for a perplexing hunt and a welcome little break for these travelers. üôÇ

  Howdy again, ZC!


  Stopped by for this one, too, on our way eastward on I-84 to the 'Gunks on this warm, hazy morning. This Rest Area is certainly much nicer than the Parking Area we just visited near Port Jervis! There were plenty of cars and trucks here when we arrived around 9:25am, but no one was any where near the vicinity of the coordinates. A small maintenance crew was at work in the open area directly behind comfort facilities and I doubt that they paid much attention to us poking around under the trees. However, we searched for at least 20-25 minutes and couldn't find the cache. In desperation we eventually decrypted the clue, but it didn't help much. We found quite a few spots that matched the hint (‚Äúsmall‚Äù is such a relative term), but still no cache. All I had with me was an older cache page printout so I didn't realize that the last person here didn't find it either. I'll send you a photo of the place where my GPSr kept bringing me back to 'cuz I'm curious to know if we were at least looking in the correct spot. If so, then it's not too surprising the cache is being found my **moogles*** and that it might have been taken yet again. I've got this cache on my watchlist so I'll be anxious to see if someone else finds it. I do hope it's still there and that I was just making it a harder find than necessary. Regardless, thanks for the cache and a chance to stretch my legs.

  * Sorry, but ‚Äúmuggle‚Äù is a Harry Potter expression and I think Geocaching really should have one of its own! I saw the word ‚Äúmoogle‚Äù used in a post on the Geocaching forums a while back and thought it sounded much more appropriate to me.
