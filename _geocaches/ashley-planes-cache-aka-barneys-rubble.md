  Hi OB!


  **Happy New Year!**


  On our way home from our adventures nearby at “Bubbling Spring Multicache,” Rich and I talked ourselves into trying one more cache. We parked just off Route 309 and hiked down the long rocky slope toward the coordinates, passing all sorts of interesting ruins along the way. I really appreciated the historic perspective you provided on the cache page; it was nice to have that information available as we explored the ruins. So often we come across old foundations or other structures and have no idea of their former purpose.


  We found the necessary information easily and hiked quickly to the next set of coordinates so that we could put the clue to good use. It was a short walk and before we even arrived Rich was saying, “We’re headed due North, right? So that means that the cache is … ” “Oh, no!” We were already feeling beat from our adventures earlier in the day, but we continued and found the going slippery, but passable. Your chosen hiding spot was immediately evident, though retrieving the cache was a bit of a challenge (and probably would’ve provided an interesting photo opportunity if we’d thought of it at the time ::wink.) The cache was well stocked and in excellent condition. I traded a Disney stamp for a plastic letter stencil and signed the logbook around 3:30pm. While hiking back up the slope toward the car, we took a moment to photograph and record coordinates for a chiseled square (a surveyor’s mark) on a culvert over Pine Creek.


  I could spend days exploring this area. (By now everyone probably knows how much I like finding abandoned structures in the woods.) Thanks for the opportunity to explore this important piece of our local history, and for sharing your knowledge and memories with us!

  Howdy, OB!


  After completing a long and successful hike to “Bubbling Spring” and back, and then stopping briefly in Rita to check out a USGS benchmark from Zhanna’s datasheets, our route home on this incredibly warm New Year’s Day brought us past a small pull-off on Rt. 309 (southbound lane) that we knew would lead to the “Ashley Planes” cache. You were certainly right about all the “moogles” in this area. As you can see, we opted for the long hike downward along the old abandoned road bed.


  We located the coal mining-era ruins where the clue for Part Two was easy to spot, and had some fun poking around, taking photos during the short period of time we spent there before moving on to the final cache. When we got to the second set of coordinates and turned in the direction indicated by the clue, we both let out an astonished, “Oh, no. Not there!” Our tails were kinda dragging by this point so the approach seemed a bit of a struggle. But we made it, in spite of the uncooperative footing conditions (don’t want to give too much away). This really is a very interesting spot and I would certainly love an opportunity to return and explore it more thoroughly. I couldn’t help wondering where some of those other roads might lead.


  After signing the logbook, I didn’t take anything and left nothing (very unusual for me!). I was definitely feeling worn out from all of today’s intense activities, and we still had the long uphill trek back to the car. (Needless to say, I slept really well last night.)


  From someone who’s extremely appreciative and respectful of the remnants of this area’s recent and colorful history, a sincere “Thanks!” for showing us another interesting place. We really did enjoy this well-executed Geocache hunt. Now, if only one of those old barneys would come chugging by and haul me back up to the top!


  Cheers, and happy caching …


  ~Rich in NEPA~
