  Hi STEARanger!


  After finding “Mining for Coal” nearby, Rich and I headed toward this cache. It wasn’t an immediate find for us, but because there weren’t too many possible hiding spots, we found it relatively quickly. The container was very well concealed and in good condition, and probably not in much danger of being discovered by muggles. Thanks for the adventure. Just one more puzzle piece to go!

  Howdy, STEARanger!


  I wasn’t planning to search for this series at all. Geocaching just doesn’t hold the same appeal for me as it once did, so I haven’t logged any new caches in a very long time. My always-amazingly-awesome wife, Zhanna, however, decided to take on the challenge of collecting all twelve of the puzzle pieces, so this morning I thought I’d go along with her to McDade Park and the Anthracite Museum in order to find pieces ten and eleven. The weather was pleasant and it turned out to be a fun little adventure. I signed the log, took nothing (except a few photos!), and left nothing. Thanks for creating this historically informative series of geocaches.
