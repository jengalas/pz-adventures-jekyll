  Hi STEARanger!


  Yesterday while I was out for my daily walk I saw someone poking around in this area, and he looked like he might be geocaching. I haven’t been geocaching in quite a long time, and although I was aware of this series, I didn’t know where all the sites were located. I checked the map and discovered that yes, there is a cache in this spot! Today I went out with the goal of finding it, and I did, without any trouble. It wasn’t very well camouflaged but it was still in fine condition. I signed the log sheet, took a puzzle piece, and returned the cache to its hiding spot, trying to make it just a little less conspicuous. Now I’m interested to see if I can complete the series. Thanks for a fun diversion!
