  Hello, ZC, for the third and final time today!


  After a perfect day of hiking and biking and exploring (and a hearty meal of snacks and beer at the Gilded Otter), I didn't think we could possibly fit in one more adventure. But Rich did in fact have something else in mind. A little stretch of the legs was just what we needed by the time we reached this scenic rest stop. We searched for a few minutes, at first expecting a hide similar to today's first cache. This strategy yielded nothing. We then decrypted the hint and I spotted it almost immediately‚ÄîI think I just happened to glance in the right direction at the right time!


  Just like we did during our first cache hunt of the day, your rest stop cache near Port Jervis, we brought the container back to Rich's car to sign the log sheet. Rich contemplated trading for the Skully & Mulder coin, but he decided against it. In fact neither of us exchanged anything this time. A moogle (thanks, R! üòÅ) in the vehicle next to us showed a momentary interest in our activities, but soon went back to his book or whatever it was that he was reading, likely without giving another thought to whatever the strange people in the next car were doing. Like many of us, he's probably seen weirder things at these rest areas. Nevertheless, we were extremely cautious when replacing the cache, and tried to distract anyone who might be watching. ‚ÄúYou wander and poke around over there,‚Äù Rich advised me. I did so while he nonchalantly (and gracefully!) replaced the cache. We then continued on our journey home, worn out and happy from the day's adventures. Thanks!

  Well, one more time today ... Howdy, ZC!


  Traveling west on I-84 this evening for our return to Scranton, PA from the 'Gunks and day filled with fun and marvelous little adventures. There was still plenty of daylight left for us to quickly pull over and stop, and to look for this cache. We arrived around 7:15pm and it took a little while to locate the container. The coordinates I'm sure were OK, but we were envisioning the same kind of hide as its sister cache on the eastbound lanes. We did eventually resort to decrypting the hint and found the container with ease. Zhanna spied it from a few feet away. Everything was intact and once again I took nothing, left nothing, and simply signed the logsheet. There was a **moogle*** sitting in his car, reading a book, right next to where we had parked. I'm sure he was wondering what we were doing, but we made every effort to disguise our real actions and even pretended to poke around in different spots just to confuse him further. I doubt he could actually see the hiding spot from his angle of view since I couldn't see it myself from my driver's seat. Thanks for the fun cache hunt!

  * I saw this word used in one of the Geocaching forum posts a while back and thought it is much more appropriate for us than the already-over-used Harry Potter expression, ‚Äúmuggle.‚Äù Maybe we can make it stick!
