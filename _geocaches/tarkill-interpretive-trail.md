  Hi, TechTalkers!


  This is the faithful sidekick chiming in. :smile: At long last, your second cache appeared on the site yesterday afternoon … when I was stuck at work. (Can you tell we were eagerly anticipating it?!) Just before 8:00 this morning I left the house and stopped to pick up Rich and his array of cache and benchmark hunting equipment, and we were on our way. It was still damp and quite chilly (I should’ve worn gloves) when we arrived at the parking area just before 9:00. The walk to the cache site was quick and very scenic. Though our coordinates differed slightly from yours, the cache was still an easy find. The inside of the container was damp, but because the contents were sealed in freezer bags, they were in fine condition. Ah, gloves! Just what I needed. These will come in handy when digging around and “gardening” on benchmark hunts. I left a wooden puzzle and my new trademark (at least for the next few caches)— a fluorescent rat. Rich and I will be sharing the First Finder’s prize; I took it home with me today. Tarkill was apparently the place to be today! Thanks so much for providing a pleasant warm-up activity to start off a mid-Fall day full of fun.

  Howdy, TT’s! Since yesterday was kind of a crappy day weather-wise, and since my faithful sidekick Zhanna wasn’t available anyway, we decided to join up this morning and get an early start in order to make a full day of caching and benchmark hunting. I just returned home a little while ago, a little bit tired and a lot hungry. I’m glad we waited ‘cuz it turned out to be a gorgeous day. The sun was shining and the air was already warming up nicely when we arrived at the cache site around 9:00AM. Spent about 5 minutes poking around before finding the cache. Zhanna and I both registered coordinates that were roughly 25 feet from the ones posted but had no trouble otherwise. It’s a beautiful area and a we enjoyed the short trek immensely. Zhanna took the “First Finder’s” prize with her. I took a pack of GPSr fuel, and left a couple of my novelty magnets, a “Mystery Treasure,” an assortment of State park maps, and the “Soaring Eagle” travel bug. So sorry we missed DB625 and the Wolfpak … oh, and Holth too! Thanks for this pleasant Fall morning adventure. (We may have been first at the cache, but we’re the last to log in!!!) ~Rich in NEPA~
