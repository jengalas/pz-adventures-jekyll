  Hi, Tri-State Geocachers\!


  Rich and I had a lot of fun “amassing our data” and eventually getting
  confirmation from Certitude. We thought the theme was great, but some
  ambiguities made it more difficult than we expected. The posted hint was a big
  help. Someday we hope to visit the area to search for the cache.


  Thanks for the challenge\!


  Zhanna and ~Rich in NEPA~
