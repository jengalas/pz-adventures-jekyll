    Hi zzbob!


    It was a pleasant surprise to see a mystery cache pop up relatively close by. We puzzled over it for a while last night, and this morning we noticed something that suddenly made the solution clear to us. Our first trip to the cache coordinates wasn’t fruitful, and we were even concerned that we might be in the wrong spot. But with our location doubly confirmed, we tried again this evening, and we were successful! Thanks for a tricky puzzle and hunt.

    Howdy, ZZBob!


    Found it with Zhanna this evening during our second attempt today.


    • Puzzle rating => **Devilishly SNEAKY!!!**


    • Cache Hide rating => **Very well concealed, coordinates spot on.**


    • Cache Location rating => **Meh. Nothing much to see here.**   


    Thanks for the cache. We will be checking out some of your other nearby Mystery caches soon.
