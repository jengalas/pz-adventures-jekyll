  Hi, Joebear21!


  Believe it or not, we’ve actually never explored Hubbard Mountain before today. We started out with a nice hike to the Hubbard Mountain Cache, and then figured we had enough time and energy remaining to attempt Pride Rock too. The cache was an easy find. Some of the contents were damp but undamaged. We signed the logbook but didn’t make a trade. Then we enjoyed a slow walk back to the car on this breezy, sunny day. I only wish we had seen some squirrels during our visit! Thanks!

  Howdy, Joebear21!


  After returning from our hike to the Hubbard Mountain Cache on this brisk, crystal-clear Fall afternoon, we decided that we were close enough to walk to this cache site, as well. A relatively easy find. The container was well hidden, but it was still slightly damp inside even though the lid was properly sealed. We didn’t bring any trade items with us so we didn’t take anything, we only signed the logbook. This is an interesting area that neither Zhanna nor I have visited before. Thanks for placing a cache here.
