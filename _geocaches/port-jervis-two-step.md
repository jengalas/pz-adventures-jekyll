  Hi, Patrick and Shirley!


  We tried this one after “Wheelin' and Dealin'” and just before “Round Robin”. Everything went well at each waypoint, though we had a little adventure at the final stage. We found the location, made a note of the required information, and were going back to the car when a woman came running up to us saying “Don't go anywhere! Don't go anywhere!” It sounded as though she wanted to give us a tour of the place. But when we entered, a man stepped out, introduced himself and asked Aaron who he was. Aaron gave his name, and the man looked at him quizzically and asked “Uhh, and why should I know you?” Apparently we'd walked in on some kind of private party and book-signing, and we _weren't_ on the guest list. (I guess in that case maybe we were the uninvited visitors?!) He told us it would be better if we returned on a summer Saturday. I wouldn't have minded trying to grab a sample from the buffet or at least the candy dish, but we felt it was best just to leave. This cache was a fun, interesting adventure — we loved it! And we learned a lot. Thanks.


  Zhanna and Aaron
