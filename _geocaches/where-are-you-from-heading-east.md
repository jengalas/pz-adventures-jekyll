  Hey, ZC!


  Rich and I were headed east on I-84 from near Scranton, PA this morning, planning on a day of mountain biking, hiking and exploring in the 'Gunks. I wasn't even thinking about caching along our route, but Rich had brought along some cache page printouts, so at least he was prepared. It was still early in the morning when we arrived at the rest stop, and there was very little activity in the area. The coordinates were perfect and we walked (or slid, in my case) right to the cache. We brought it back to the car to be a little more discreet and minimize our time spent right near the hiding spot. We signed in, but traded nothing. The cache was re-hidden quickly and were off to the next rest-stop cache along the way, your “Weary Traveler” at Middletown. Thanks for a fun little diversion and a nice warm-up for the rest of the day's adventures!

  Howdy, ZC!


  Traveling east along I-84 from Scranton, PA this morning on the way to the 'Gunks for a day's worth of (hopefully!) exciting adventures—caching, benchmark hunting, mountain biking, sightseeing and general exploration. This Parking Area wasn't too busy when we arrived around 8:45am. There was a rig situated near the cache site but I think the driver was still sleeping. Not easy being stealthy at this point. We did try to confuse and distract anyone who might be watching. Found the cache quite easily, the coords lead right to it. It was hidden with care and everything was in good shape. Took nothing, left nothing, and signed the logsheet. Since this is not the, umm ... _most attractive_ of places, we didn't spend time taking photos as we usually would. We just wanted to get back on the road again. Thanks for the fun cache!
