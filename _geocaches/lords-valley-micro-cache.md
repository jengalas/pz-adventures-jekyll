  Hi, tmwolfe6!


  This was certainly an unusual micro cache. It’s probably the first one I’ve found while inhaling simultaneously the aromas of exhaust fumes and hot french fries. (Turns out one of those proved to be irresistible. I’ll let you guess which one.) While our coordinates differed from yours by around 60 feet, the hiding spot was obvious to us as soon as we parked. The cache was well-hidden; it’s just that after so many finds we have a pretty good idea where to look! :sunglasses: For the second time today we had a convenient spot to sit while signing the log sheet. Because I had nothing small enough for the container, I did no trading this time. No one bothered us while we were logging in, or even looked twice. The key to this one is to go about your business while blending into the background. It was daring of you to place a cache here—I hope it lasts.


  Thanks for a nice little hunt to end our busy day of geocaching, hiking, and benchmark recovering. The snack we purchased nearby was also most welcome!

  Howdy, tmwolfe6!


  Spending the day with Geo-buddy Zhanna in Pike County hunting caches and benchmarks. Did “Split Rock Mini Cache” near Ledgedale first, recovered two NGS benchmarks in the same area, and then drove over to the Lords Valley interchange for your micro-cache. Afterwards, we scouted out a couple of other benchmarks for future recovery, and rewarded ourselves with an afternoon snack at McD’s. Had no real problem finding the cache even though the posted coords were leading us to a place about 62 feet away. We were able to pick out the most obvious hiding spots as we pulled into the parking area. Must be that 6th sense called geo-intuition at work again! There were a couple of big rigs nearby but we simply pretended to be having lunch at the site and nobody gave us a second glance. I didn’t take anything, nor did I have anything small enough to leave, but I did sign the login sheet. Sorry, we took no photos here. After all, we were kinda burnt out from all the photography we’d done earlier. Thanks for a nice little cache hunt and the opportunity for a welcome break during our rather exhaustive day-trip. Cheers, and happy caching …
