  Rich in NEPA and I solved the puzzle and the solution checker gave us the
  green light. I doubt we’ll be visiting that area anytime soon, but we’ll put
  it on our list and if we have the opportunity we’ll stop and search for the
  cache. Thanks for a fun puzzle\! P.S. Now I’ll have that goofy song stuck in
  my head for the rest of the day. :roll\_eyes:
