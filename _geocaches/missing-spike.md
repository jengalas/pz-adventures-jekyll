  Hi, Sickticket!


  Greetings from a fellow Pennsylvanian. 🙂 What a surprise to see one of your caches here in Maryland! As always, it was a pleasure to hunt and to finally locate your cache. At first we did have some trouble with the directions from the tank, but once we got on the right track everything started to make sense. The cache was in fine condition and was hidden well. We left a lightstick, and I took a hair tie and the “Watch Your Step” travel bug. After rehiding the cache we watched a few planes take off and land, and then we headed to Assateague Island for the rest of the morning. Thanks for a fabulous on-vacation geocaching experience! 🙂
