  Hi, WG!
// TODO: come up with new language for this cache? 

  Rich and I picked up this moving cache on a cold and horrendously windy morning in Tobyhanna State Park. In its place we left a rock with a red "X" drawn on it in case anyone should search for the cache before seeing our logs. We have a few ideas where to place it next, but we're waiting for a slightly less bitter day before we venture outdoors again. Like Rich, I enjoyed finding this unique cache and reading the logs from geocachers nationwide, and I would love to see new moving caches allowed in the future. If I were Queen, they would be encouraged.

  Howdy, WG! Just wanted to let you know that your cache has been picked up and is out of play for the time being. A small flat rock with a red “X” on it was put in the hiding spot as requested. I don't know what possessed Zhanna and me to go out on such a nasty, cold, wickedly windy day but we had these grand ideas of getting this cache and then doing some serious benchmark hunting in the area this morning. The weather during last few days has been horrible and the urge to get outdoors again was irresistible. But after snagging the cache at the park and then locating one easy benchmark near an old railroad control tower in Tobyhanna, I just could not tolerate the brutal wind-chill anymore, decided to call it quits and started heading home. We anticipate that sometime over the weekend one or both of us will be placing the cache in a new location, and we'll post a note here on the cache page as soon as possible. Zhanna is keeping the cache safe so I'll make my trades later. Thanks for the opportunity to finally get to take part in a moving geocache. I like the concept very much and wish this type of cache was still allowed. ~Rich in NEPA~
