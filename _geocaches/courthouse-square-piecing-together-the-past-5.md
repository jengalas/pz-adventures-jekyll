  Hi STEARanger!


  On today’s walk I wandered over to Courthouse Square to continue my hunt for the puzzle pieces in this series. The coordinates weren’t of much help here, so I admit to using the hint, which made this a pretty easy find. Retrieving the cache container required stealth since the area was so busy this afternoon. Everything is in good condition. Thanks for the hunt!
