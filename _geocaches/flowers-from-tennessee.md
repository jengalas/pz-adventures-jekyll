  Hi, KLifeMom!


  This was our final find of the day. We could hear two people on the rocks not far away, but they didn't see us. We were able to search thoroughly and found the cache without much trouble. It was very well hidden! I left my mark in the log, and I also stamped it with a flower stamp from my friend Rich in NEPA, who was here in spirit. Of course I stamped my own journal, too. This was a lovely little spot, calm and peaceful in the heart of the busy city. Thanks for a satisfying end to a wonderful geocaching day!
