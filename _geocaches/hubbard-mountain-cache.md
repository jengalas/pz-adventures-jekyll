  Hi, Josh391!


  For some reason, Rich and I had never visited Hubbard Mountain before. I had fun driving up Rustic Lane, but we decided to hike the powerline toward the cache rather than drive it. The stunning view provided a colorful backdrop to our cache hunt and sign-in. It was busier on the mountain than I’d expected. During today’s adventures we passed several vehicles, one jogger, and one mountain biker. We’ll be back here for sure. Thanks for a fun cache and an awesome view in a place so close to home and yet completely new to us!

  Howdy, Josh391!


  Zhanna and I hit the trails on Hubbard Mountain this afternoon mainly to take advantage of the gorgeous Fall weather. We parked under a powerline just off the paved, aptly-named Rustic Lane, hiked roughly a mile to the cache site, and found the container without any trouble. It was hidden well enough and in good condition. Since we hadn’t actually anticipated doing any geocaching today, we didn’t have any items with us to trade. We signed the logbook, took nothing, and left nothing. Also, we hung out at the overlook briefly, enjoying the crystal-clear skies, the stiff cool breeze, and the spectacular scenery. Thanks for putting a cache in such a fine location!
