  Hi, BFClan!


  We certainly picked a cold day for our North Jersey adventures! When we left the house this morning the temperature was in the low 20s and though the day was brilliantly sunny, the temperature didn't rise much throughout the morning. Rich drove us in as far as possible on the rutted and rocky Brink Road, and we hiked the rest of the road to the Appalachian Trail and then uphill to the ridge. There was a surprisingly beautiful view and a surprisingly brisk wind. Guess it's time to start getting used to winter weather again! The coordinates were right on and the cache was found in fine condition, with Waterboy's bottle of water—not yet ice!—lying at its side. I took the travel bug Java the Pup with me, and I left a small Ello set (no, I've never heard of it either, but it's some kind of construction toy). It was much too cold on the ridge to write my usual amount in the logbook, and unfortunately we didn't get the opportunity to take any photos, either. We did consume a small snack just to keep ourselves going! Once we were back on the trail and descending, we warmed up considerably. On the way down, we had a very pleasant meeting with Buzz and Abby, his feisty canine companion, who were on their way to the cache. We stopped for a pizza and Snickers picnic and to look for the nearby “Night at the Leanto” cache on our way back to the car. Thanks for a fine hike and a cache hunt that will be remembered as part of a very unusual day!

  Howdy, BFC! This area is somewhat familiar to me since I was here almost one year ago for the “Night at the Leanto” cache. Traveling this time with Team Zhanna & Aaron we approached from Walpack Center, past Tillman Ravine, and along old Brinks Road. Had no real problem finding the cache and the coordinates I registered where spot on. The view was marvelous from here, but that cold stiff wind was making me so anxious to get back down onto the trail again. I quickly signed the logbook, took nothing, and left two of my Geocaching magnets. Out on the A-T once again we didn't go very far before we encountered Buzz Lightfoot making his way to the cache with his frisky, friendly dog Abby. We stopped to chat for a bit (a pleasure meeting you, BL!), then continued to the leanto where Zhanna & Aaron proceeded to look for the cache while I lounged in the sunshine at the picnic table. We had a nice little noontime snack during the logbook signing, chatted again with Buzz who was now returning to his car, then it was time for us to leave. This section of the A-T was extremely busy today. All in all it was a fine little adventure and the first of what was to become a day filled with most unusual experiences. Thanks for a very nice hunt. ~Rich in NEPA~
