  Hi, J & L!


  We came right over to this one after completing “A Literary Stroll”. The sun was still bright and beautiful, though it was getting low in the sky. We found all the parts pretty easily, and we really enjoyed our little tour of this park. From the cache we took the blue agate, and we left an Art Vandelay trading stone in its place. (I was considering taking Clifford for a friend, but I decided against it at the last minute. 😈) This is a very picturesque and peaceful spot! I only wish the museum had been open. Thanks for another interesting Lehigh Valley stroll!


  Zhanna and Aaron
