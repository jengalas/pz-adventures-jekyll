  Hi, LRs!


  I too found the “other” camera and was standing there while on the phone with Rich waiting for him to spot me. He kept saying “Can't you see those two carts with the red and white striped awnings?! I can't believe you can't see them!” Well, they were nowhere near me, so I thought I'd walk up and down the boardwalk till I saw something that matched what he was describing. As I walked, the skies opened up and the rain came down in sheets. I spotted the carts, ran toward them and ducked my head underneath so I could at least keep the phone dry. Finally, Rich could see me, and now all we had to do was to wait for the rain to stop. It didn't, but it did lessen a bit, so we were eventually able to get a few more shots. Thanks for another tricky and fun boardwalk webcam cache!
