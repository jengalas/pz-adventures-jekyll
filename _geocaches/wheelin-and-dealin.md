  Hi, Patrick and Shirley!


  What a great location! The landscape was really beautiful and we spent a good amount of time there, even though the best time for foliage has passed and we were being snowed on as we explored the area. The cache was an easy find only because, as you said, there aren't too many likely hiding spots here. It was, however, well hidden and I doubt a non-geocacher would ever find it. We took the Bright Sea Geo-log travel bug, and in its place left a small Lego set. This spot would be lovely (although buggy :sunglasses:) all lit up on a summer night. Thanks for sharing with us yet another little-known treasure!


  Zhanna and Aaron
