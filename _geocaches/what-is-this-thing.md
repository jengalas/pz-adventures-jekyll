  Hi, PaulCasey!


  Fueled by quiche and grilled margherita sandwiches (and yes, a scone and a chocolate-iced vanilla cupcake) from nearby Zummo’s, Rich, Dad and I took an investigative stroll along the Scranton section of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. I’ve only hiked one small section of this part of the trail before, and at that time it was still more rail than trail! For the most part we were extremely impressed—both by the condition and beauty of the trail, and by how many people were out enjoying it in various ways.


  We were nearly back to our car after a 6+ mile walk when Rich spotted the “thing” and said “I think there’s supposed to be a geocache here.” A minute of poking and peeking around and we had found it. The container is in fine shape and it was easy to retrieve without attracting attention.


  The Lackawanna Heritage Valley Authority’s website has some background information about the object: [“Confluence” Art on the Trail](https://lhva.org/Confluence.php).


  Thanks for a fun addition to a beautiful morning’s walk!


  Zhanna

  Howdy, PaulCasey!


  Out for an after-breakfast stroll with Zhanna and her dad. First time on this section of the LHVA rail-trail for me. It is an excellent area resource and I’m always glad to see so many people utilizing and enjoying it. I had previous knowledge of this geocache and since we were passing right by I figured that now was an appropriate opportunity to grab it. The container was hidden well enough and in excellent condition. Signed the log and replaced the cache as we found it. As to what the object itself represents, unfortunately, I haven’t got a clue! But it is quite unique and interesting. Thanks for bringing me to this location.
