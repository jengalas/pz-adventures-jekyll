  Hi, Stepss!


  While on Broad Mountain for some great mountain biking on this very hot and humid day, Rich and I stopped by to check on your cache. Neither one of us had brought the cache page or the coordinates, and it did take us a while to stumble across the cache. I had expected to walk right to it, but once in the area things looked different from how I'd remembered them. I enjoyed reading all the past logs, including my own from October 2002 and Rich's ‚ÄúFirst Finder‚Äù log from January of that same year. Recently I've played with numerous orange newts I've found along the trails on our way to other geocaches, so I simply couldn't resist taking the ‚Äúnewt‚Äù rubber stamp. Luckily I had with me a homemade keychain/zipper pull to trade. After rehiding the cache and fooling around taking photos (or trying to! üòâ) for a few minutes, we continued on to enjoy the rest of this mountain's beautiful trails. Our lunch was boneless spare ribs, which we ate on the ledge overlooking the Oxbow Bend; then I attempted to perch atop the rock column near the ledge but wimped out. Too bad, because it would've made for a great photo. We explored the rocky trails to Glen Onoko falls and I particularly enjoyed the stream crossings because getting soaked was the only way I was able to cool off today. Thanks for the memories and for providing an excuse for a longer ride!

  Howdy, Stepss!


  I don't know if you're still doing much Geocaching these days but you might like to know that your cache is still here. We came down to the Jim Thorpe area for a day of mountain biking on Broad Mountain so it seemed only fitting that I should feel the need to make a short detour to check on your cache. (The trail that branches off the main loop and leads to the cache site is technically off-limits to bikers, but since I am a notorious outlaw anyway, those little plastic orange triangles are not going to stop me!) It has been exactly 2¬Ω years from the date that I first found this Geocache, and what dramatically different weather conditions there were! Today was warm, sunny and very humid. We found the cache tucked securely in its hiding place but it was quite visible at just the right angle and from a few feet away. A turkey hunter had discovered it in May, signed the logbook and very graciously left a trade item. I guess he hasn't logged his visit on the Website yet. Oh, and Waterboy's trademark bottle of water is still there, too! I didn't take anything, but I added a Geo-logo magnet and a cyclist's key-‚Äúchain‚Äù to the booty and recorded my visit in the logbook. Zhanna and I snapped a few (off-center! üòâ) photos before rehiding the container and then we continued our tour of the mountain and the many overlooks.


  Cheers and happy caching/biking/hiking!!!
