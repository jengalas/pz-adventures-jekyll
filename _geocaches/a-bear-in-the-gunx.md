  Hi, TeamLF!!


  I was so excited when, during a bike ride on Thursday, Rich mentioned that he was interested in visiting the 'Gunks today. The first and only time I visited in the past was almost two years ago, when he and I hiked to Getrude's Nose and, calling ourselves ‚ÄúTeam Recoverers of Lost Caches‚Äù found **Fraggle Rock**, which had been presumed missing.


  Our trip began early in the morning. Along the way we stopped for two rest-area geocaches **Where Are You From Heading East** and **Weary Traveler**, finding only one of them. Due to the negligence of our navigator, we also did _not_ find the [bakery](https://www.ilovethebakery.com/) where we'd eaten our breakfast and purchased trail snacks last time. ü§≠ We ended up taking another route into town, which I personally thought was more scenic and adventuresome than the Thruway. üòõ (But I'm still sorry we missed out on the baked goods.)


  A short smooth drive through this beautiful wilderness brought us right to the center, which we decided we'd visit after finding the cache. Once near the coordinates, I had some trouble finding the right spot. Rich found the cache pretty easily, though, and after stumbling around a bit and walking through cobwebs, I spied it too. I left a pin and took a little pearly pink frog, and we were happy to find a convenient place to sit and rest while signing the logbook. We took a leisurely walk back along the little trails to the visitors center, which neither of us had visited before. I spent so long studying the model of the ridge‚Äîgeology fascinates me but I don't know enough about it‚Äîthat I missed out on some of the other exhibits in the center. I'll have to make a special stop next time to view them. Our next activity after geocaching was to recover the benchmark right across the road from the entrance to the visitors center. We then spent the rest of our day riding the carriage roads around the Preserve, and then hiking the remaining distance toward the bizarre and spectacular Mountain House. We ate our lunch of cold pizza in a little wooden gazebo overlooking the lake, and on our way back to our bikes we explored the challenging (especially when wet and slippery!) Labyrinth trail, which I loved. The perfect day was made complete by supper at the Gilded Otter and a simple cache hunt on the way home.


  What a beautiful place this is!!! As Rich remarked toward the end of the afternoon, it's like visiting another planet even though it's only a two-hour drive from home. The lush forests and winding trails and awesome rock formations are like nothing we have near Scranton. We've already planned some activities for our next two or three visits here! Thanks for a ‚Äúbear-y‚Äù well done cache and a memorable part of our day full of adventures.

  Howdy, TLF!


  We are spending the day in the 'Gunks for a variety of exciting adventures‚Äîcaching, benchmark hunting, mountain biking, sightseeing, and just some general poking around and exploring. I've been to this absolutely enchanting region quite a few times in the past and I consider it one of my most favorite places on the planet. But it's been almost two years since my last visit here, and it's my first time at the visitors center. I really enjoyed all of the exhibits, especially the scale model of the spectacular Shawangunk escarpment. We found the cache around 10:50am after a few minutes of searching. It was tucked well into its hiding place and everything was in good condition. I took the little green frog, and left one of my cyclist's key-‚Äúchains‚Äù and a Geo-logo magnet. Then I signed the logbook and we took a few photos. Before leaving the parking lot we did a full recovery of the benchmark ‚ÄúX 255‚Äù that's located along the highway across from the entrance. I'm surprised that no one has logged this one yet. Afterwards we continued up to the Trapps parking lot, got on our bikes and worked our way along the carriage paths on the Mohonk Preserve to the lake and the intricate Guest House.


  Thanks for the fine and very memorable cache hunt.
