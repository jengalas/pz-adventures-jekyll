  Rich in NEPA and I began working on this puzzle with a clear idea of what we
  needed to do, but it ended up taking much longer than we expected. We had to
  use a lot of trial and error because there were quite a few possibilities for
  one part of the puzzle. After exhausting those possibilities, we were at a
  loss until we happened to stumble upon another source that gave us one more
  option to try, and that one worked\! Thanks for a fun challenge\!
