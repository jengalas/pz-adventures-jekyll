  Howdy, Bigmada!


  Our first reaction after several minutes of searching at and around the coordinates was: is this some kind of sick joke?! We solved the puzzle on the cache page easily enough and verified the answer a couple of days ago. This morning we happened to be returning home from another kind of scavenger hunt in Montrose, PA and Zhanna suggested making a quick stop at Lake Carey to complete this geocache.


  All we found at the “most obvious” spot, near the coordinates, was a “travel bug” of some type, and another object on a chain that looked like the cap or top from a tiny container. Both objects were lying on the ground, out in the open. On the backside of the sign we found a QR code, and on the signpost were two black plastic zip-ties. No container and no logbook. The hint on the cache page was of no help. The QR code, which we couldn’t look up until we had cellphone service at home, turned out to be another weird, unfathomable mystery!!!


  I don’t know if someone “muggled” this cache, or if we just didn’t find the correct location/item. However, the CO may want to do a quick check to see that everything is still in place. If all is well, we will definitely come back in a week or so to try our search again. In addition, we can remove the photos from our log here if the CO feels they are too revealing.


  As always, thanks for placing this cache!
