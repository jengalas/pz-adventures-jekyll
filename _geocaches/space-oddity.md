  Hi there!


  I was beginning to think I’d never get to this cache, but today’s little trip provided the perfect opportunity. After a fun First Find at the nearby Blooming Grove Hiking Trail cache, we had some time to try this one as well. The hike in was very enjoyable, especially because of the lack of bugs. We crossed the stream on a fallen tree (this is happening frequently of late, and our skills are improving!). Being the gentleman and master geocacher that he is, Rich kept a good distance away as I approached the site and looked for the cache so as not to influence my search. Heavy tree cover made reception very spotty but once in the right area I found the cache without too much trouble; unfortunately, the container was exposed. (I’m glad I got to it before the deer hunters begin to frequent the area.) The cache was in great shape otherwise. There are some nice treats inside! I took a Worthington State Forest map because I couldn’t remember whether I had one in my collection. I left a neat Ocean City keychain. We then concealed the cache as it had originally been hidden when Rich found it back in May. We took a slow walk back to the car and then located a nearby benchmark before calling it a morning. I have yet to visit the Space Oddity, but we have plans to return to the area soon. Thanks for a satisfying challenge and a very well done traditional geocache hunt!

  Howdy, BL! Arrived on the scene around 9:20am. GPS reception was very spotty and relying on a good measure of that “GeoCacher’s intuition” I walked right up to the spot, spied some disturbances in the surrounding leaf litter, and quickly pulled out the cache. No need for hints. It was in good condition and hidden very well, just as you described. I spent quite a bit of time playing with the items inside, signing the logbook, making trades, and taking photos. I took the fascinating fossil rock so I could study it more carefully at home (I will pass it along at another cache so others can examine it, too) and left two of my Geocaching magnets, a Wet Towel, and an assortment of State park guides. I’d describe the area as soggy and damp but not especially wet or buggy, with bright green moss growing everywhere. It was cloudy and calm this morning, and the woods were extremely quiet. I liked the stream very much and walked a good length of it on my way back to the car. After returning the cache to its hiding place I was getting ready to leave when I heard the sound of twigs snapping underfoot and noted the approach of two unmistakable GeoCachers. Turns out it was none other than The Wolfpak. It was really nice to finally meet these avid cachers and fellow Mid-Valley residents. Thanks for a fun time. I’ve been to the “Space Oddity” many years ago. ~Rich in NEPA~
