    Hi, zzbob!


    We had so much fun working out your other nearby mystery caches that we decided to try Tipitina as well. This one was much easier for us, and it didn’t take long before Certitude confirmed my answer. Rich wanted to work it out himself so I held off on researching the final location until this morning. Unfortunately, now that I’ve seen the map and satellite view, I think that just like “Five Card Hand,” this one may be better to search for at any time of year other than mid-July! If we’re in the area, maybe in the fall, we will certainly give it a try. Thanks for another fun puzzle!

    Howdy, ZZBob!


    This was definitely a much easier ZZBob puzzle than the last few we worked on. Zhanna solved it right off. She really is the puzzle nerd! Took me quite a bit longer but I finally dredged up the correct answer, confirmed by Certitude. Nice puzzle, though! On the other hand, once I got a look at the aerial and street views of the location as indicated by the coordinates, I decided that I’m not particularly interested—especially at this time of the year—in making the trip just to rummage around in it. For me, it’s not about the numbers anyway. I’m content with having solved the Mystery puzzle and posting a note here on your cache description page. If, by chance, we happen to be in that part of NEPA in late Fall or Winter, AFTER the vegetation has died back, we may be more inclined to stop for a quick search for the hide.


    As always, TFTC.
