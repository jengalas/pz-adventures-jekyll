  Hi, Jarhead28!


  Well, apparently I was about two hours too _early_ for the First Find. How is that possible? Well, I’m not sure, but I was there at 10:00am, and the cache wasn’t. I searched every inch of the item in question, as several firefighters and an EMT can attest to. No cache … but when I came back at 5:45pm, I walked right up to it. I have to wonder if the cache page was published a little while before it should have been.


  Thanks to downward I was able to take half of the First Finders prize anyway, and I left my signature. Thanks for a nice excuse to get outside on such a lovely day, and for a chance to meet some of our local emergency team members!
