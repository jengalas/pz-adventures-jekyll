  Hi STEARanger!


  After yesterday’s find of “Forging Ahead!” (number 7 in this series) I knew I had to attempt a few more. This geocache was another reasonable goal for today’s walk, and it was an easy find. It’s probably best to search for this one in the evening when fewer people are roaming around and driving past this spot. The cache was in excellent condition, dry inside and plenty of puzzle pieces left. Thanks for the fun hunt!
