  Hi (again)!


  This was the second cache of yours I found today (and the second one to draw my blood! üòâ). The park gate was closed when I arrived, but I parked in front of it and walked in. I guess I was lucky because I found the cache easily (it was not visible, don't worry), but retrieving it was quite another matter! I eventually got it, and I took the cache to a covered location to look through the contents. There have been several finders who haven't yet logged their finds on the site, and the travel bug is gone. I took nothing and left one of Rich in NEPA's geocaching magnets. As I was writing in the logbook, the rain stopped and the sun actually came out for a few seconds! It was glorious. Thanks for a unique challenge!

  Howdy, Johnsons06! There was still plenty of time on this beautiful Fall Sunday to skip over to the other side of I-81 and try for another one of your caches. Third of three for today. Arrived on the scene at 1:00pm. It was mostly sunny, breezy, and the day was feeling much warmer. This park was totally deserted, which was fine with me 'cuz it made extricating the container an easy matter and without the worry of being seen. The posted coordinates got me to the precise spot, and it was obvious where I'd have to search, without needing to decrypt the clue. Cache was very effectively hidden. I signed the logbook while relaxing lazily on a park bench. Took nothing from this cache, but I did leave a yellow vinyl Geo-Logo decal, one on my Geocaching magnets, a ‚ÄúMystery Treasure,‚Äù and an assortment of State park maps. The Travel Bug was already taken. Thanks for a pleasant Geocaching experience in a part of northeast PA that I seldom get to visit. ~Rich in NEPA~
