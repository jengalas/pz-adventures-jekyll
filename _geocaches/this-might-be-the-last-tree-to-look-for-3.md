  Well, since so much time has passed, today Rich and I hiked back up the mountain for our First Finders’ prize. Not that I mind having an extra $5 in my pocket, but it's really a shame that no one took us up on the challenge. These “tree¨ caches are all worth a little extra of your time and effort, in my opinion, and this was probably the most straightforward of the bunch.


  We still hope that someone will take an interest in this cache and give it a try soon. It seems to me that because the tree in question can be viewed from several widely-spaced points, it may be possible to triangulate its position with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Anyone want to try and let us know how it works out?
