  Hi, BW!


  **Happy New Year!**


  Two New Year’s Days in a row with sunshine and above average temperatures is too much to hope for, but somehow we’ve managed to experience just that in NEPA. While last January 1 was still brisk, however, this New Year’s Day was truly exceptional—a real beach day!


  Our adventure began at the SGL parking area along Lake Francis Road near the powerline. Having taken too quick a glance at the map we headed straight up the trail from the parking spot; that led us to the powerline. We followed the powerline trail up and then down a steep hill before realizing that we really should’ve been hiking along the gas pipeline instead of the powerline cut. :open_mouth: Our topo map indicated a connector trail, and we planned to bushwhack to the nearest point, pick up this trail and follow it to the pipeline and the first stage of the cache. But not thirty seconds after making this decision, I spotted another trail which led us north and then turned sharply west, eventually bringing us to the woods road we’d seen on the map. Much better than bushwhacking, and beautiful wooded singletrack to boot! (We’re coming back with mountain bikes.) From the intersection of the woods road and pipeline it was a quarter-mile hike to a colorful view and the first stage of the cache, which we found easily.


  Reaching the second stage required a short bushwhack through swampy woods. We were a little disappointed to find nothing at the coordinates to indicate we were in the right spot, but I understand that this was probably intended to add to the challenge. A loose interpretation of your directions and a careful search were enough to bring us to the hiding spot, which was really neat. Though it was breezy on this side of the mountain and chilly in the shade, we sat for a while snacking and logging our finds. I traded two Disney character rubber stamps for a French and a German coin. We then followed the singletrack trail we’d hiked earlier back to the powerline, getting “buzzed” by two obnoxious dirt bikers along the way.


  On the powerline the air felt at least 10 degrees warmer and I was wishing I’d worn shorts. We were dreaming of just lying down on the grass and sunbathing! There were no squirrels to be found all day, so Rich set up a few stone “pseudo-squirrels” along the cut and we had some shootin’ gallery fun before heading back to the car.


  Thanks for a cool adventure on a warm day! Your first cache turned out well, and I look forward to more in the future.

  **Chapter One**


  Howdy, BW!


  New Year’s Day began early with a flurry of e-mails to Zhanna about what to do, where to go, and who was going to drive. There was considerable exhortation to head up to Great Bend for GMBC’s “Rosy Jeopardy” series, but we knew little of the snow cover up north and I couldn’t get overly enthused with the idea of lots of bushwhacking, thick laurels, and slippery hillsides. My own preference was to travel south again to SGL #187 (we had fun there a little over a week ago with the “GODZILLA” cache) to explore other sections. And “Bubbling Spring” would provide a good opportunity. From the maps it looked like a potentially good place to hunt for squirrels as well.


  So, around 9:30am we met at my house, loaded up Zhanna’s SUV (Again, thanks for driving, Zh!), and **iQue**’d our way to the little town of Rita (where we didn’t follow instructions and got slightly off route) and then to the gamelands parking area. And yet once more, in spite of all the technology and maps we brought along (a little familiarity with an area is often much more useful, I suppose!) we still chose the wrong trail. We followed the powerline instead of taking the gas line, which would have been the direct route. However, all was not lost. Once we realized our error we paused to replot a new course—one that would have required a serious bushwhack if Zhanna hadn’t spotted a not-so-obvious singletrack trail which lead to an old woods road, quickly putting us onto the gas line and close to the first part of the cache. Whew!


  At the start of our trek, the sun was shining brightly, the air was calm, and temps were amazingly warm. I was already feeling a little over-dressed and actually wished I’d worn shorts! Could this really be January??? We found Part One after a few minutes of searching. We entered the new destination and spent some time enjoying the view and snapping pics. On this side of the mountain, though, conditions were dramatically different. It was colder and very windy. I had no desire to hang out there for long, so we took off in search of a trail that would (hopefully) take us to Part Two.


  (The story continues below …)


  **Chapter Two**


  (Continued from above …)


  Just a short distance back along the gas line was a well-used ATV track leading off in the proper direction. But it soon turned sharply downhill and we had to leave it for another bushwhack of about 0.2 miles and across a small stream. The woods were rocky at first, but we soon found ourselves in a very wet area at the stream’s source. You could easily hear the sound of bubbling waters underfoot!


  The final cache was more difficult to pinpoint. Signal reception in the heavy woods was causing our position fix to bounce around like crazy. Eventually, we settled on a spot that seemed to be a good average of our readings, then we tried to locate the offset and the cache. The following info might aid future searchers: neither of us brought a compass, but using our GPSr’s in sort of a “reverse GOTO” at the location of the cache itself, we both noted a distance of 250 feet and a bearing of 70° (250° minus 180°). I don’t think we’d have found it, at least not quite as easily, without decrypting the hint.


  Great hiding spot! The ammo can and all contents were in excellent condition. After signing the logbook, I took two small foreign coins and left a Sacagawea dollar.


  Having set waypoints for the singletrack trail we found earlier, our GPS receivers told us we were only 0.11 miles from the point where it intersected the woods road, so we made a beeline there and retraced our route back to the car. We didn’t see a single squirrel during the entire trip!


  Thanks for a challenging and memorable cache hunt, and the long, invigorating hike. Cheers and happy caching …

  P.S. I’d like to come back with mountain bike and check out the gamelands further, especially for a ride on that sweet singletrack trail. The coordinates for the endpoints of that trail we followed are: `N41°06.276′ W075°54.006′` (powerline end) and `N41°06.455′ W075°54.184′` (woods road intersection).
