  Hi!


  Well, there was no snow for us today (finally!). It was really a beautiful day for a walk, and this was our first hike of the year in shorts. We combined this cache hunt with the search for the nearby “Love Shack and Beyond” cache. We had no trouble locating the cache, and everything inside was in fine condition (except that, as Rich noted, several pages of the logbook have come loose). This time we traded a small Lego set for a state park map. Nearby are several great spots to rest in the sunshine, so after replacing the cache that's exactly what we did! Thanks for a great hike in a park that we'll be visiting again to explore further.


  Zhanna and Aaron
