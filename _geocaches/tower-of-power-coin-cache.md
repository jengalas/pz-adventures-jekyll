  Hi there!


  We were staying less than two miles to the north, so once the skies cleared on this fickle-weather Sunday we took a walk down the beach to the tower. I literally walked right up to the cache! You chose a clever hiding spot and the container was well concealed, so I guess I was just lucky. We moved away from the area to sign the logbook; it was a wise move since a young man came over to explore the tower while I was still writing. Would you believe I left my Ukrainian coins at home?! ðŸ˜Ÿ I wanted to remain true to the theme of this cache, so we traded nothing. This was a fun little adventure, and I appreciated the opportunity to see one of the towers up close. I've noticed them from the highway for years but was never sure of their accessibility. Thanks!!!

  
  Zhanna and Aaron
