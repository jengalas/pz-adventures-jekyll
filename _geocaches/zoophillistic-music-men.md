  Howdy, Brewer Fan Club\! (Wish we knew what, if any, the inference here is.)


  Once again you’ve kept us chasing our tails on-and-off for several weeks, with
  many red herrings to lead us astray and byzantine rabbit holes down which to
  get lost\! Then Zhanna came across a resource that sparked an idea. A similar
  type of solution that we actually did attempt, but not with the correct
  arrangement. This one did the trick, however, and gave us the green, finally.
  As is the case regarding your other puzzle caches around the Middletown area,
  we don’t get out this way very often, but if and when we do, we have added
  this to our growing list of intended geo-hunts. Thanks for yet another fun
  mystery challenge\!


  ~Rich in NEPA~ and Zhanna
