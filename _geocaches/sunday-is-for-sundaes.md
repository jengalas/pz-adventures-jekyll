  Howdy, Gilwell1! (That is your name, right?! It gets confusing!) :smirk:


  Zhanna and I solved this puzzle quickly and easily. Zhanna came up with the right “twist” on our second try. The Solution Checker confirmed our results. Unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll be visiting this area anytime soon. But we are putting it on a list of your other nearby puzzle caches that we have solved. And if we should happen to get the opportunity, we’ll stop and search for these caches. Thanks for a fun “brain-freeze” of a puzzle!
