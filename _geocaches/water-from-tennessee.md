  Hi!


  Well, this one didn't turn out exactly as we'd hoped, but we had an interesting adventure anyway. We arrived at the area after finding a few other Central Park caches, and Aaron, parched and hungry, stopped at the nearby 'Hydration Station' for a soda and some $2.50 M&Ms while I attempted to search for the cache. I began at the location specified and expanded my search in several directions. But I was only able to search for ten to fifteen minutes; there were way too many people in the area and some were staring suspiciously. I was about to call off the search and come back on a weekday, when Aaron pointed to a promising spot and asked if I'd checked in there. Well, I hadn't, but when I looked in I saw what appeared to be the corner of a plastic bag. It wasn't what I was expecting, but I figured it was still possible that this was the cache, so with Aaron shielding me I pulled out the bag. My prize was a large plastic bag containing a thick envelope. Still thinking this might be the cache, we took it up on top of the rocks and opened it. Inside the envelope were two small books wrapped in red paper. I started to doubt I'd found what I was looking for. I opened one of the books and saw that it contained pages and pages of what appeared to be poems and sayings (possibly in Spanish or a similar language?). Opening the other journal I found more of the same, except that this book also contained a pressed wildflower and some diagrams and sketches. What an interesting find -- someone's personal cache! I wanted to put it back immediately and was able to do so after waiting for some tourists to leave the area. We decided to move on to another cache; I'm interested to see if this one might still be in place, though it doesn't appear likely. Thanks for a 'not found' that was definitely not disappointing!
