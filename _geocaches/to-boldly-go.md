  Rich in NEPA and I solved this puzzle quite easily and we got the green light
  from the solution checker. I doubt we’ll be visiting the area anytime soon,
  but we’ll put it on our list and if we have the opportunity we’ll stop and
  search for the cache. Thanks for a puzzle that was truly out of this world\!
