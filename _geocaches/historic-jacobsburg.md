  Hi, Team SAR-Dogs!


  Ever since I got my new bike I've been waiting for the opportunity to bring it down to Jacobsburg for some of the great riding I enjoyed here last year. I knew it would be even better now that I've gotten rid of the old bike that was slowing me down. I wasn't sure where we'd end up this time, but Rich had brought along printout of this cache page and it sounded like a worthwhile adventure to me. I love multis that can be done by bike. We parked in a different spot than the one you suggested and rode the trails and streets toward the first set of coordinates. The first three stages of the hunt were well-hidden but we found them without difficulty. Retrieving them, however, was tricky business. These areas are blanketed by poison ivy, so watch where you step and what you touch! Satellite reception was poor near the final stage, and it took us a bit longer to locate the cache than it had for the earlier parts. I was searching a good distance away when Rich announced he'd found the cache. Our trading reflected a “cat” theme! The Pez dispenser Rich took was shaped like a kitten, and I traded a Hello Kitty stamp for a ceramic cat ornament. After rehiding the cache, we retraced our route back out to the road and then headed to a nearby Rails-Trail to search for another cache and some benchmarks. Thanks for a well-planned adventure that provided a nice warm-up for our day of riding and caching!

  Howdy, Team SAR-Dogs!


  Drove down from the Scranton area early this morning for a day of mountain biking, Geocaching and benchmark hunting in and around J-burg S.P. The weather looked very promising for a change—sunny, cool, a little breezy, and finally low humidity! Also, Zhanna was anxious to try out her new Trek bike on some buffed singletrack. We parked at the main lot on Belfast Road and worked our way over to the suggested start for this cache hunt. No problem finding any of the stages, but I would like to pass on a word of warning that all parts except for the last one are heavily guarded by poison ivy, both the shrub and vine varieties. J-burg is rife with PI and, personally, I get itchy all over just looking at it!!! From this well-stocked cache I took the Pez dispenser left by PezPatrol, and traded a Geocaching magnet, two cyclist's key-“chains” and an assortment of State park maps. From here we headed over to “Harley's Hike” cache and check out the Rails-Trail. Thanks for getting our day off to a fine start.
