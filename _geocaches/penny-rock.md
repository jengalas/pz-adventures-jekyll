  Hi, pendotron!


  It's been a while since Rich and I visited Salt Springs S.P. As it turns out, my father, Dave, invited us to join him this morning for a drive to Montrose for the annual Blueberry Festival and a breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes. This was an offer too good to pass up!


  Afterwards, dad suggested a hike at Salt Springs, which gave us an opportunity to check on this geocache. Our hike along the Hemlock Trail brought back lots of fond memories. Along the way we made a brief stop at Penny Rock for photos and to add another penny to the collection. We found your new cache container without any difficulty. It was nicely hidden and in good condition. No muggles today, either. We recorded our visit in the log and then concluded our hike via the Hardwood Trail. Along that trail we saw a red eft and some interesting moss that we have yet to identify.


  Thanks for adopting and continuing to maintain this geocache! :grin:


  Zhanna, Dave and ~Rich in NEPA~
