  Hi STEARanger!


  This is a great hiding spot! I found the cache this evening on another walk around town. The challenge here is to know which way to approach the site. I signed in, took a puzzle piece (there are plenty left) and sat for a minute before continuing on my walk. Thanks again for adding a nice goal to my evening stroll!
