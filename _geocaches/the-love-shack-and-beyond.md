  Hi, Jane and friends!


  What a fun cache. We started from your suggested parking area and took an easy stroll up to the shack. While Aaron rested on the porch, I found the letterbox, and then we searched for the first stage of your cache. We had no trouble finding it, and it's still in good condition. Then we sat for a while on the porch of the shack and enjoyed the lovely warm day! The cabin itself is so neatâ€”I love finding structures like that in the woods. On our way to the second part, we searched for another cache in the park and then finished up by finding your main cache. It was an easy find, though we felt we were being watched by some kids on the nearby rocks. I waited till they left before pulling out the cache. Though the bags were wet, the container was dry inside, and everything was in fine condition. The wind picked up suddenly while we were looking through the contents, but we managed to catch everything before it blew away. ðŸ™‚ We didn't trade anything this time. Thanks so much for a great hike and hunt in a very beautiful area!


  Zhanna and Aaron
