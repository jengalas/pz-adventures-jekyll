  Hi STEARanger!


  Continuing the theme for this week, I found this cache while on my daily walk. The information in the hint made it easy to zero in on possible locations; fortunately I picked the right one first. Everything is in great shape and no one was nearby to bother me while I searched and signed the logbook. Thanks for the fun hunt!
