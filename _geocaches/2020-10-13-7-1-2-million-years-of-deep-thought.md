  This puzzle had us scratching our heads for a couple of days. Then I had an idea, and it turned out to be right! We got the green light from the geo-checker along with the parking coordinates. The location is a little out of the way for us, but if we happen to be in the area we will try to find the cache. Thanks for a fun puzzle!
