  Hi, Johnsons06!


  Yet another dreary day, but I decided to go caching anyway. Like Rich, I thought I was going to get out before the rain hit. The drive up through Hop Bottom and Dimock was dry, but as soon as I got to the parking area, the skies opened up and it was pouring before I got into the woods. I thought I might see Rich (hard to miss that cache-mobile in the parking area!) and I did run into him just a few hundred feet from the cache site. (Yes, it was a very pleasant surprise. üôÇ) He waited for me while I searched for the cache. It didn't take me too long to locate it, and Rich came back to take the photo of me as I signed the logbook (and to administer some first aid for my bleeding finger -- thorns attacked me). I took nothing and left nothing this time, though this cache was very well stocked. This is a really beautiful area! I wish we could've seen it under brighter, drier conditions. I had a great time; thanks!

  Howdy, Johnsons06! Tried to beat the wet weather by getting a fairly early start this morning but I didn't succeed ... at least not for long. Once on the trail I was immediately taken by the sight of this pretty little forest with its secluded swamp. And as I neared the water a flock of wood ducks took off in flurry of beating wings and startled squawks. Arrived at the site around 9:00am and found the cache without any difficulty. My GPSr got me close enough that I didn't need to decrypt the hint. The container was well hidden and there were quite a few nice things inside. I didn't take anything, but I signed the logbook and left two of my Geocaching magnets and a ‚ÄúMystery Treasure.‚Äù As I was departing the area I was greeted by another pleasant surprise. Zhanna was making her way along the trail and to the stream. (Hope the rest of your Geocaching day was drier, Zh!) Thanks for a pleasant Fall morning trek. I had a lot of fun despite the deteriorating conditions. ~Rich in NEPA~
