  Hi, Techtalkers!


  Your new cache appeared on the site at a convenient time—late enough that we didn’t worry about anyone attempting it last night, but early enough that we had some time to prepare. :grin: Unlike yesterday, this time we got moving early and enjoyed the easy drive to Blooming Grove (I’m sure Rich enjoyed it more after I turned off the Russian pop music). Thanks to previous geocache and benchmark hunts we’re already quite familiar with the area, so finding a parking spot close to the cache posed no problem. The morning was cloudy and cool, and the atmosphere in the woods was enchanting. Plenty of fall colors have popped up among the green, and they brightened our surroundings. The woods were so peaceful and quiet during our short stroll to the cache site. We were impressed by the well-crafted log bridge we encountered as we approached the coordinates! (Did you build that just for us?! :wink:) Rich and I both found the cache without much delay. It was in excellent shape as expected, and it contains some quality goodies. I really liked the travel bug, but we left her in the cache as we’re not sure when we’ll be placing our next cache. I added a funny travel bug I picked up in Ocean City, Maryland a few weeks ago, along with an Ocean City keychain. From the cache I took the deck of cards (which I, unwittingly, held in my hand while Rich was photographing the contents). We spent some time relaxing in the area before taking a slow walk back to the car and embarking on another cache hunt and benchmarking adventure. Thanks for a gorgeous walk and an excellent geocaching experience!

  Howdy, TT’s! After yesterday’s unusually late start I made sure that I was up in plenty of time this morning, ready and raring to go. I met with Zhanna (who graciously volunteered to drive today) about 7:30am to attempt a joint “First Find” for this brand new cache. Following a mild and very pleasant hike under cloudy skies, cool temps, calm air, and no bugs (yet!) on gorgeous trails we arrived on the scene at 8:20am. Found the cache after about 10-12 minutes of searching. [According to a 20-minute waypoint average, my GPSr indicated that the hiding spot was roughly 45 feet to the southwest of the posted coordinates. Take this for what it’s worth since signal reception is very spotty. I also noticed when I first saw the cache page last night that there is an error in the parking coordinates. This didn’t cause any problems since I had a good idea what trails the cache was near.] I didn’t take anything from this well-stocked container, but I left 2 of my custom magnets, a custom cycling keychain, and an assortment of State Park maps. Thanks for a superb little adventure. I’m glad that you finally got this cache approved and online. It’s been a long wait, but I’d say it was worth it. ~Rich in NEPA~
