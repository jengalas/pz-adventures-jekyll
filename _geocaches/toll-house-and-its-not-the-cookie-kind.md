  Hi again, ZC!


  You know that Rich and I can't resist the opportunity for a First Find, especially if the cache has been sitting idle for a few days! Sunday morning provided the perfect opportunity for a drive out to North Jersey. This time we picked up an extra sidekick (Aaron) and we all piled into Rich's ultimate cachemobile, ready for adventure. It was frosty but sunny when we left Rich's house and not any warmer when we arrived at the site. At the area indicated by the coordinates we found very little to conceal a cache, so we expanded our search to more likely spots nearby. It wasn't long before Aaron asked “Am I supposed to tell you if I found it?” Wow, we were impressed! Aaron hasn't geocached in quite some time. “Just don't tell us where it is,” I replied. We continued to search the likely area with Aaron watching over us all the while (he said he felt weird, but believe me—the people who haven't yet found it feel even weirder!) Eventually I found the cache in a hiding spot I was sure I'd checked earlier ... and Rich found it very soon afterwards. We made our trades—I kept the boot lace and left a fluorescent green rat—and took a few photos. Thanks for a challenging morning hunt that was much more fun than the traditional cache-and-dash!

  PS Now I'm hungry for Toll House cookies! 🙂

  Howdy, ZC! Here I am again, two days later at another one of your caches. Left the house bright and early along with companion cachers Team Zhanna & Aaron. First hunt of the day and it took a bit of searching but after about 15 minutes eagle-eye Aaron locates it without giving away the hiding spot. Zhanna and then I find it on our own a few minutes later around 9:45am. The posted coordinates were leading us about 30 feet due north of the cache, however there is a fair amount of trees at the site to have thrown us off. Signed the logbook, took nothing and left a Varmint Hunters Association patch which was the only thing I had that would fit. The day was certainly brisk, but the sky was clear and the sun felt nice and warm. Thanks for a nice hunt. ~Rich in NEPA~
