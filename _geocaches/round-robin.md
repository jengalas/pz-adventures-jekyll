  Hi, patw!


  This was a neat historic spot, and the cache was an easy First Find once we learned how to navigate that convoluted 'system' of roads in the immediate area! There were certainly plenty of signs to help get us there, though. Lots of fun, even on a freezing cold day with snow flurries in the air. Thanks!
