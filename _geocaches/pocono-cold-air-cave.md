  Hi,


  Maybe things aren't looking so good for this cache. Aaron and I visited in late afternoon and while we didn't search extensively for the cache (due to the huge numbers of tourists who kept arriving on the Water Gap Trolley), we did poke around a bit and came up with nothing. The clue was very precise, but we found nothing in the indicated location, and we did our share of rock-lifting as well. Maybe jon3bek hid it so even cachers wouldn't find it?! ðŸ˜® I enjoyed exploring the little cave anyway, and if the cache is still here, I'll be back!


  Zhanna and Aaron
