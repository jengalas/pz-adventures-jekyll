  Hi, cache kids!


  We found this cache around 5:00pm during a long but wonderful day of geocaching in the park. Tree cover was a slight issue in this area, but the coordinates got us close enough that I was able to find the cache without much trouble. I agree with previous finders -- nice hiding spot!The cache was in good condition and contained more than I expected, including a travel bug. I added my mark in the logbook and stamped my own journal, and then we traded a new egg of Silly Putty for the Spiderman travel bug. This was located in a very pleasant area and we felt we had more privacy here than at the other caches we visited today. Thanks!
