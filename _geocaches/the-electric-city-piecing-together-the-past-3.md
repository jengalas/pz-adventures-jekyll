  Hi STEARanger!


  I took a longer walk today and found another piece of the puzzle at the Trolley Museum. I don’t think the cache was in its proper location when I found it, based on the previous logs, but since I don’t know where it was supposed to be hidden, I couldn’t replace it in the correct spot. I’ve sent a message to let you know. Thanks for another fun hunt and a chance to explore the trolleys and Steamtown!
