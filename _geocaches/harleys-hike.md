  This puzzle had us scratching our heads for a couple of days. Then I had an idea, and it turned out to be right! We got the green light from the geo-checker along with the parking coordinates. The location is a little out of the way for us, but if we happen to be in the area we will try to find the cache. Thanks for a fun puzzle!

  Howdy, Harley's Pack!


  In the area today with Zhanna for some mountain biking, Geocaching and benchmark hunting in and around J-burg S.P. I've never been on the Plainfield Township Trail before and wanted to check it out, at least the portion near Belfast and Stockerton. I understand that it goes all the way north to Pen Argyl. This ought to make for an easy-going group ride with some friends one of these days.


  On the way to the cache site we stopped to search for a benchmark but were unable to locate it. We found remnants of a concrete culvert off to the side of the trail and suspect the mark has been destroyed. But we had no problem finding the cache container. There's already a little social path leading to it and I suppose that sort of thing is difficult to avoid, especially when the vegetation is so lush this time of year. I didn't take anything from this well-stocked cache, but after signing the logbook I left a Geocaching magnet and a cyclist's key-“chain.” I saw the Spoon TB but the Geocoin was not there.


  The only real disappointment came when we read the previous logs and saw that we missed both Tyson and the Caching Nuts by only a couple of hours. From here were went on to successfully recover two other NGS benchmarks. Thanks for a truly great time!
