  Hi, FM!


  Your cache was our third find on this sunny but very chilly day. The main goal of our hike in this area was the nearby “AT Detour” cache, but since Aaron and I hadn't found “Night at the Leanto” yet, we stopped to search for it on our way back to the car. Rich waited at the picnic table while we searched, and within minutes I came up with the cache. It wasn't in the best of shape; the container is cracked, the lid doesn't close tightly, and the contents were moist. We brought the container back to the table to let it air out while nourishing ourselves with a tasty lunch of pizza and sweet snacks. The warm sunshine felt great! Partway through our picnic, Buzz Lightfoot and his dog Abby appeared. We'd met them earlier on their way to “AT Detour”; they were now on their way out and stopped to chat for a few minutes. Abby was very interested in our snacks, but Buzz was able to satisfy her with some Nutter Butter cookies. We left one of Rich's funny magnets and took the Skully & Mulder Geocoin. Thanks!


  Zhanna and Aaron

  Howdy, OFTGFM! Looks like I'm the first one here. Cache was an easy find—the coordinates led me right to it. The container was quite visible. However, it was still tucked away within it's hiding place so I don't think it was disturbed after you placed it there. I kinda get the impression that this cache was placed on a whim. Perhaps not such a good idea. Let's hope it doesn't require maintenance. It's not very well stocked, either. I can't help wishing that it was better thought out from the beginning. That said, you did pick a really fabulous area to place it. I've been to Tillman Ravine quite a few years ago but I never came this far up the mountain. It was very quiet and peaceful here today. A gorgeous sunny and calm Fall day with the temperature around 50° upon my arrival at 10:00am. I didn't take anything, and after signing the logbook I figured I'd upgrade the cache contents by leaving two of my Geocaching magnets, a wet-wipe towelette, and an assortment of State park maps. Also, since there was no Geocaching note inside, I wrote the pertinent cache information on the cover of the logbook. I enjoyed sitting in the sunshine and listening to the leaves dropping in the woods before heading back to my car! Thanks for an interesting morning. ~Rich in NEPA~
