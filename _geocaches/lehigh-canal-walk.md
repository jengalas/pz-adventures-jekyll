  Hi A & L!


  The walk along the canal was a relaxing activity for the end of a great day full of geocaching and benchmark hunting. The weather was much more cooperative today than it was last June when I was here, when the temperature was about 102° and the air was thick with humidity. Today we walked under sunny skies in dry air with a gentle breeze. And it’s such a picturesque area! Though the cache was well-hidden, I was lucky and spotted it right away. It took Rich a few minutes more, but he found it once he moved the object that was partially obstructing his view. He’s right—I wouldn’t have minded a little more space in the log to write one of my novels … but to be honest, I needed a break anyway after all that digging for benchmarks! :grin: We sat on the bench and talked until I almost dozed off. Rich and I seem to be spending a lot of time near canals lately, but it’s always a pleasant experience. Thanks for a fun little cache hunt in a pretty, tranquil spot.

  Howdy, Mike & Kieu! As usual this was a “classic” WWW cache hunt, with all the necessary ingredients for a fun time and a memorable experience. You guys never fail to impress! I’m writing this log a day late due to the fact that yesterday turned out to be a long and busy Saturday. Both Zhanna and I wanted to make the best of what lately seems like such rare, unpredictable, and highly desirable caching weather. After two cache hunts (one long and one shorter) and three benchmark searches (which were deceptively difficult—we found only two of them), and a total road time of 3½ to 4 hours (Zhanna’s turn to drive) I arrived home late in the evening longing for some fresh garden tomatoes, a tall glass of beer (make that two!), and a long hot bath. The logs and photos would have to wait. The morning started very early—around 6:00am with a check to see if this cache had been logged yet. Then quick breakfast—gear in the car—head out to meet Zhanna. There were already cars in both parking areas on Bake Oven Road, along with a group of hawk watchers ensconced in folding aluminum chairs. As we approached the area for the first part of the cache, I heard some noises in the woods to my right that didn’t quite sound like the usual squirrel activity. Once at the site itself we noticed another cacher in the midst of his own search, which explained the curious racket heard earlier. We spotted the container and bottle of water, but waited for the “stranger” to approach and discover it himself. As he got closer our suspicions about whom it might be were confirmed. We chatted with Tyson for a bit while entering the new coordinates, then headed off in the direction of the final cache. All the while as I scrambled across the boulders I thought Tyson was behind us right on our heels but, curiously, as we left the trail to the second cache site, I turned and he was nowhere to be seen. The cache was an easy find, so we quickly took only the logbook and left the container hidden as we found it, and then moved off to a safe distance with the intention of letting Tyson find it on his own, as we were sure he’d prefer. Eventually, it all worked out and we gathered again at the cache for the signing-in and trading, as well as the typical photo session and some more geo-chatting. I took the lobster keyring (thanks so much for the souvenir from Mount Desert Island!), and left a “Mystery Treasure” and two of my signature Geocaching magnets. Lots of other great stuff in there, too. After all was said and done, we parted ways with Tyson (it was a real pleasure meeting you again), headed back up to the knife edge, and lounged there for a good hour or more while we snacked and soaked in the view and the sunshine. Adding to this fine adventure was a timely encounter with Jinx and Magic, who were the next visitors to the cache this morning. (A real treat to meet you guys!) Thanks, WWW, for a great time! ~Rich in NEPA~
