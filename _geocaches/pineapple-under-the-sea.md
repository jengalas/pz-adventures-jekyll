  Hi MJ!
 

  I'd hoped to spend part of Thursday afternoon searching for this cache, but when I arrived at the park ... well, take a look at the photo to see why I couldn't even get out of the car. The rain just kept coming and coming. It was probably the heaviest rain I've ever experienced! Driving out on Coastal Highway was a real treat, too. ðŸ™‚ If this cache is still in place, I'll try it next time I'm in town! Thanks anyway ...
