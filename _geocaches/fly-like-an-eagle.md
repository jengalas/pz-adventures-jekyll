  Hi, 4F&D!


  I was in the area today hunting benchmarks with Rich in NEPA. After several successful—and several unsuccessful—recoveries, he suggested we take a drive along the river so that I could finally do this cache. Luckily he still had the coordinates in his GPSr, and I was able to navigate here without a problem. Funny, I’d just commented on a similar sign nearby! There were no eagles or nests to be seen, but this is still a lovely place to watch the river. Too bad it was such a chilly day or we would’ve spent more time hanging out here, snacking on pizza and pies as usual. Thanks!

  Howdy, 4F&D! I’ll bet you can’t believe it took me so long to get here. Well, honestly I was contemplating doing a biking trip along the Lackawaxen to the Roebling viaduct once Spring and nicer weather arrived. I’m still waiting for the nicer weather! This morning was cloudy, cool, damp and breezy. I’d just completed the nearby “Space Oddity” cache so naturally I couldn’t pass up this one. Found the little pull-off without a problem and was prepared with binoculars and long-lens digital camera for capturing some bald eagles. Unfortunately, the eagles were very shy and uncooperative. I spent close to an hour and a half sitting along the river bank and at two other pull-offs but not a single eagle was to be seen. There were lots of noisy crows, though! Anyway, it was just so nice hanging out here snacking on a Tastykake lemon pie, with the river all to myself. Thanks for the fun! A verification photo has been e-mailed. ~Rich in NEPA~
