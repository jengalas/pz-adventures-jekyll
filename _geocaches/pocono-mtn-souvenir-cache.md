  Hi, Skypath!


  As Rich noted, I did see your cache listed on the site late last night. Rich had already gone to bed so there wasn’t much sense in alerting him till morning. Early this morning we connected by e-mail, quickly agreed on a plan, and I was at his house without delay. (I was even a little quicker than R had expected, I believe!) When we arrived at the suggested parking area no other vehicles were in sight, but we realized we were certainly late enough that another geocacher might have found the cache already and left. Seeing the cache almost in plain sight as we approached the coordinates contributed to that sinking feeling. But no … we opened the container to find the contents neatly packed and a logbook still waiting for its first entry! I guess the Poconos area is known for rather bizarre souvenirs—or maybe all “souvenirs” are bizarre? Anyhow, the cache was filled with unusual items from a marshmallow shooter (Caution: Use Only Miniature Marshmallows!) to squished pennies to a glitter-coated rock (that was more Lionel Richie’s style). I decided on one of the pennies and left in its place a pink fluorescent rat that supposedly glows under blacklight. After taking a few photos and while I was writing in the logbook, we heard someone walking toward us from the direction of the brook. Great, I thought, just what we need—to be harassed by the locals. Upon hearing a command to “Abigail”, though, I relaxed. It was only another geocaching team, Buzz_Lightfoot and his trusty Golden, Abby. The humans chatted for a while as Abby, eager to find the cache herself, danced around us. After posing for a few more photos, Rich and I headed off in pursuit of further adventures. Thanks for a fine start to a gorgeous, sunny, fun-filled November Sunday!

  PS Yes, Buzz, you were first to log on the site. But we had a full day of benchmark hunting planned … not to mention, we live much more than 7.71 miles away! :smiling_imp::stuck_out_tongue::smiling_imp:
