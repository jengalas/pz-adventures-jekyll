  Cache maintenance: I was in the park today to search for a nearby letterbox, and after locating that I decided to check on my own cache. I was surprised when I (finally) found it in a spot that was about ten feet away from the original location. It was hidden well—obviously it had been moved by people, not animals—and nothing inside was disturbed, but I'd appreciate it if finders would not change the location of the cache. (If there is a problem, feel free to e-mail me and I will check on the cache, and move it if necessary.) I took out the trash, and I replaced the cache in its original hiding spot, covering it well. The falls are wild after all that rain!
