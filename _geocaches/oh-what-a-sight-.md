  Hi, blitz10035!


  It’s been a long winter, and today’s beautiful weather offered the perfect opportunity for a hike at Bear Creek Preserve, a new spot for me, Rich, and my dad. We haven’t gone geocaching for a long time, and it wasn’t part of our plans today. But when we took a break to explore the overlook along the yellow trail, I noticed a small crevice in the rock that looked like it would be a perfect hiding spot for a geocache. There was nothing to be found in that spot, but the idea inspired me to check our phone to see if any geocaches were nearby. To our (mild) surprise we were within 65 feet of a geocache! Rich searched around and found it quite easily. Unfortunately, the container had not been properly sealed and the contents were wet, including the log sheets. We signed our names and traded nothing. Thanks for your efforts in placing this geocache!

  This is my first time visiting the Natural Lands Bear Creek Preserve. This morning, while on our way to the Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour at Northampton Community College, we (Zhanna, her dad, and I) planned to hike and explore a small section of this preserve. When we arrived at the yellow trail overlook Zhanna suggested that we check for any nearby geocaches. Her smartphone immediately indicated that there was actually one right here! An easy find, of course, even though it was hidden quite well. The bad news, however, is the contents were soaked. The container wasn’t sealed properly because the Ziploc baggie with the log sheets inside was trapped under the edge of the lid. This allowed water to seep inside. With some care we manage to sign the damp log sheets, but there wasn’t enough time to try to dry out the container. Anyway, thanks for placing this geocache. We enjoyed the area and the trails. And we hope to return soon for further exploration.
