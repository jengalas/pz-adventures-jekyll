  I really like these kinds of puzzles\! Rich in NEPA and I solved the puzzle
  and the solution checker gave us the green light. I doubt we’ll be visiting
  the area anytime soon, and I realize the cache might be gone by then anyway,
  but we’ll put it on our watchlist and if we have the opportunity we’ll stop
  and search for the cache. Thanks for a fun challenge\! P.S. OK, National
  Spelling Bee, here we come\!
