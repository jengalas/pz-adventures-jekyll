  Howdy, “Ed”\!


  After losing the scent twice, ace inspector Zhanna tracked down and
  apprehended the crafty solution. Yes, we got the green light\! However, we
  probably won’t be visiting this area anytime soon but we will put it on our
  to-do list, and if we should have the opportunity we’ll stop and take a look
  for the cache. Thanks for the wild goose chase.
