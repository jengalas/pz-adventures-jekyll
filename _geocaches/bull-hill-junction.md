  Hi, EFB!


  Bull Hill Junction was the first of two of your caches we Northeast PA adventurers found on this beautiful November Saturday. Our day began early: we left home at 7:30am, determined to fully enjoy the forecasted warmth and sunshine, as well as make the most of one of the last weekends before the exceptionally short, dark days of Winter set in. Arriving just under two hours later at the suggested parking area, we followed the rocky blue-blazed Lone Star Trail north, bypassing the Split Rock, and then west to the junction.


  Here we all felt the need for a little break. I turned on my GPSr and we discovered that your cache was conveniently located less than 100 feet away from where we stood. The cache was well hidden, but the coordinates were excellent and the three of us spotted it simultaneously. We had some fun taking photos while signing the logbook, and then I decided to take the tick tweezers (just in case!) in exchange for the homemade signature items left by Rich. A few hikers passed through the junction while we were busy at the cache site, but overall this part of our hike was quiet and peaceful.


  After rehiding the cache, we chose the white-blazed Washburn Trail and followed it south toward the summit of Bull Hill, en route to amazing views, an NGS tri-station, and another cache of yours. Thanks for a great start to a lovely mid-Fall day of hiking, exploring, and enjoying the breathtaking views of the East Hudson Highlands. Our story continues at Mt. Taurus!

  Howdy, EFB!


  Mostly due to the fact that I have a backlog of caches from as far back as June, and also because I’ve been more intent on hiking in new areas, I haven’t been going out specifically with geocaching in mind for the past several months. If there happens to be a cache nearby or along the trail, we’ll usually stop for it, but seldom do we go too far out of our way for them. We’ve tried to limit our focus to the hike itself, and lately we’ve found ourselves very interested in the Hudson Highlands, both the west and east sides of the river. This was our first visit to Mt. Taurus. Zhanna found a hike review on the ‘Net the other day and it sounded interesting enough, and of about the right length for a day-trip this time of year.


  We met around 7:30am, arriving about 1¾ hours later at the Lone Star trailhead parking area off Fishkill Road. The sun was shining brightly, temps cool but warming, and the air calm. The weather was already looking awesome for early November. Our goal today was a 6-mile circuit hike to the summit of Bull Hill (~1200 feet above the parking spot!) via the Lone Star, Washburn, Undercliff, Nelsonville and Split Rock trails.


  Zhanna had brought cache description printouts for several of the nearby caches as well as for the NGS tri-station, and she had preprogrammed her GPSr with the coordinates so that we could quickly locate these points along the way. At the junction of the (G) and (W) trails (we now have all of the NYNJTC maps), we took a rest break and looked for the first cache. This one was an easy find. The container was well hidden, and everything inside was in good condition. After signing the logbook, I left a couple of my signature geo-magnets in exchange for the tweezers/magnifier, which I gave to Zhanna to keep in her backpack. We snacked a bit while goofing around for snapshots. Then it was back to the trail, and onward and upward. So far, we were enjoying the hike and the area immensely!


  Thanks for placing this cache and adding to our day’s adventures.
