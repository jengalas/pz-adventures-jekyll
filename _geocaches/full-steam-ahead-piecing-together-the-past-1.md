  Hi STEARanger!


  I found this geocache while on a Sunday walk around the city, just before finding the one close by at the trolley museum. As I approached the coordinates I could see the cache container lying out in the open. It was pretty clear where it was supposed to be hidden, so after signing in and taking a puzzle piece, I replaced it and concealed it as well as I could. Everything is in good condition. Thanks for another fun hunt!
