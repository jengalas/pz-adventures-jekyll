  Howdy, Captain!


  Today I was Zhanna’s “helper” and this puzzle turned out to be a quick and easy one. We had a good idea how to solve it as soon as we saw the grid. We got the solution and the green light on our first try! Since we probably won’t be visiting this area anytime soon, we will add it to our growing to-do list, and if we have the opportunity we will stop by and take a look for the cache. Thanks for the puzzle. Now you have us craving a sizzling steak & cheese submarine sandwich!!!
