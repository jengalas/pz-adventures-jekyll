  Hi!


  This was our first Central Park cache of the day, and our first letterbox cache ever. It took a while to find, due to the excellent hiding spot and the fact that four people were staring intently at me almost the whole time I was searching (“Oh no, he's taking off his shoes... this could take a while!”) Fortunately, the spot I'd been searching wasn't quite right, and when I finally found the cache they were unable to see me. In the log I left a copy of my mark, which I will eventually have made into a stamp, and I also marked it with a stamp that Rich in NEPA got from a cache in Maine. (He's visiting the city today too, but only in spirit.) We started off our own letterboxing journal with your cute little stamp. Thanks for a very different sort of cache hunt!
