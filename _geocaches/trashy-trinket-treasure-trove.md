  Hi, Pserine!

  We haven’t been geocaching or hiking in ages for several reasons, and I was thrilled when Rich suggested trying a little hike this warm and sunny morning. It was great to be back on the trail. We found the cache without any trouble, and we left a keychain and a fun magnet. Thanks for a nice cache hunt to ease us back into the game!

  Howdy, Pserine!

  Zhanna and I were out for a little hike on Meyers Mountain while I’m still recovering and rehabbing from recent knee surgery. We haven’t been doing very much geocaching these past couple of years due to other interests and priorities, but we still like to hunt for a local cache every now and then. Found this cache in good condition and nicely concealed. Didn’t take anything; signed the logbook and left a Cinram anniversary keychain and a funny magnet. Thanks for a fun cache hunt!
