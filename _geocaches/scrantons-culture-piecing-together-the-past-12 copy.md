  Hi STEARanger!


  I incorporated this cache hunt into my daily walk. Somehow I managed to time it just right between the rain showers and storms! Despite the potential for a really tricky hide I found the cache after a few minutes of poking around, signed in and took a puzzle piece. The bag was open and pieces are getting damp, but everything is still in decent condition.


  Thanks for another interesting challenge!
